<p>Provides a Sequence diagram capability.</P>

<h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>A historical note:
ArgoUml's Sequence diagrams now have had 3+ implementations: pre- 0.14,
an incomplete 0.14 thru 0.18 implementation, which
inspired an implementation by the
current author, which was introduced in the 0.19 timeframe.
There is
also some code implemented by Peter Nabbefeld, this is described in the section: 
'work_sdnested_epdv Branch Implementation'.</P>

    <p>Sequence diagrams are different from the other diagrams in that:</P>

<UL>
 <li>there is a lot of automatic layout to perform.</LI>
 <LI>The source and destination connection
points of edges are not centred on the node they are connecting to.</LI>
 <LI>If one edge is removed it is possible that other edges must be
repositioned or even deleted due to the sequence of messages.</LI>

<ul><li>Persistent Structure (PGML / UML model)</LI></UL>

    <p>The model is updated at the specification level; the object lifetimes
in the sequence diagram are associated with ClassifierRoles; the edges are Messages.
Each message is associated with an action, which may be Call, Create, Destroy, or
return.  For the model to serialize correctly, the actions have to be associated
with a state; a state in a state diagram for the model is created for each message.</P>

<ul><li>Save / Load procedure</LI></UL>

    <p>Each FigClassifierRole create a FigMessagePort fig at every point that
it sends and receives a message.  The FigMessagePort objects are associated with
the FigEdge objects by their Y position; this is how the diagram is re-connected
and the messages positioned when the diagram is loaded.  The PGMLStackParser
pgml implementation lets FigClassifierRole control loading itself; otherwise,
the FigMessagePort object positions would be ignored.</P>

<ul><li>Diagram rendering / editing implmenentation</LI></UL>

    <p>Each FigClassifierRole contains an array of MessageNode objects
that designate a port--a point where a message can be sent or received.  The
array stretches the length of the lifeline.  When a message is actually created,
each end is associated with a FigMessagePort that is itself associated with
a MessageNode in each FigClassifierRole.  When drawing the activation boxes,
the array of MessageNode objects is traversed by a state machine; sending
or receiving a message triggers a change of state that may start or end an
activation box.  The state that is associated with each node also determines
the messages that may be sent or received there.</P>
