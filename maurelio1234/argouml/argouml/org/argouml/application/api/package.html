<!--
Comment for the editor:
 The local links to #interfaces and #classes does only work in the
 generated package-summary.html page and not in the generated
 overview-summary.html page or the generated index.
 There is probably some magic mangling of this file done by the 
 javadoc generation.

 TODO:
 I will redirect to the package-summary.html page and hope that
 that page will be available in the generated javadoc.
