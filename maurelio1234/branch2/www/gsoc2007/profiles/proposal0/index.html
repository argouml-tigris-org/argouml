<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">First Proposal for Profiles
Implementation</span><br/>
<br/>
After having studied the current ArgoUML code, I have coded a minimal prototype
of what I think profiles should be in ArgoUML. At this page I'm going to discuss
the main modifications I propose. I have generated a patch containing all the
code modifications I have done. This patch can be found
<a href="argouml-profiles.txt" title="here">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The following class diagram illustrates how profiles could be implemented in
ArgoUML:<br/>

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">The Profile's concept</span><br/>
<br/>
A profile is mainly an object of the
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Profile</span> class. This object is in charge
for providing a model where ArgoUML can look for the defined stereotypes, tag
definitions and etc, a formating strategy (used to format the element names
according to the namespace). In future, it can provide wizards, critiques,
figures and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There are two ways to deliver a new profile: as a plug-in or as an XMI file. A
profile defined as a plug-in can offer more specialized services, as special
critics and automatic registration. I have put an exemple of plug-in profile
<a href="profile-javabeans.jar" title="here">here</a> (source code
<a href="profile-javabeans.src.zip" title="here">here</a>).<br/>
<br/>
This plug-in defines a micro-java beans profile. It defines a
&lt;&lt;Bean&gt;&gt; and a &lt;&lt;Property&gt;&gt; stereotype, and a critics to
enforce the constraint "A &lt;&lt;Property&gt;&gt; can only be applied to a
&lt;&lt;Bean&gt;&gt;'s attribute".<br/>
<br/>
A plug-in delivered as an XMI file is a
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">UserDefinedProfile </span>object that just
provides a model from where ArgoUML gets the definition for the stereotypes, tag
definitions and primitive types. There's an example of XMI profile
<a href="threading.xmi" title="here">here</a>. It defines a reduced
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">threading profile</span> (don't try to figure
out what it is ;)). It defined two stereotypes, &lt;&lt;activeThread&gt;&gt; for
classes and &lt;&lt;communicationChannel&gt;&gt; for associations, a datatype
called <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">mutex</span> and a tag definition called
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">priority</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The support for both strategies is very important, because supporting XMI files
allows the creation of new profiles by the user with almos no effort (just
define the profile using ArgoUML and export the XMI file). The support for
profiles defined as plug-ins is also important, because the information
contained at the XMI model is not enough for a rich user experience. UML allows
the user to define the new stereotypes as subclasses of the metamodel
metaclasses and to define OCL constraints 'constraining' the application of
these stereotypes.<br/>
<br/>
The main problem here is that the most ArgoUML can do with the information
provided by the XMI file is to check if the profile is being correcly applied.
But it would be very difficult to try to provide more useful information like:
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">why</span> is the profile not being correctly
applied? <span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">how </span>can I change it to make it
correct? and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">The Model loader</span><br/>
<br/>
The model loader interface intends to isolate the profile code from the code
used to load the XMI model. This is just part of the effort to remove everything
that's not related directly to profiles from the
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Profile</span> class.<br/>
<br/>
The class hierarchy under the <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">ModelLoader</span>
interface tries to avoid unecessary checks and repeated code.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">The ProfileConfiguration<br/>
<br/>
</span>This class should contain all the information related to profiles and
that should be kept as part of the object. It contains the links to all the
applied profiles and the notion of <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">default
profile</span> (the profile that is going to be used as default model -- I don't
know yet exactly what is it). The
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">ProfileConfiguration </span>has also a method to
gather the models of all Profiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">The ProfileManager<br/>
<br/>
</span>This class is responsible for keeping the list of profiles available to
be applied to current project. To illustrate its functionalities I have
implemented a new settings tab for projects that can be used to view the
profiles currently applied and allows the instalation of new XMI profiles.<br/>
