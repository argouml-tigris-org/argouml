Support for multiple notations and languages. 

<h2>Package Specification</h2> 

 <h3>Definitions</h3> 

   <dfn>Language</dfn> in the context of ArgoUML 
   is the representation of a model fragment, 
   either as visible <code>notation</code> or as <code>code</code>. 

   <p> 
   <dfn>Notation</dfn> is the representation of model fragments 
   as part of a diagram. 
   <p> 
   Notation may not only be pure text: UML attributes/operations 
   may have graphical text properties (underlining, italics) with a 
   semantic relevance. 
  
   <p> 
   <dfn>Code</dfn> is (hopefully) syntactically correct text that is 
   stored in files for the purpose to be processed by a tool 
   (for example, by a compiler). 

   <p> 
   A <dfn>generator</dfn> converts model elements or portions thereof into 
   textual representations, either as notation or as code. 
   No generators are required for a language.  Certain languages (UML) may not 
   even support code generators. 
  
   <p> 
   A <dfn>parser</dfn> processes textual notation or code 
   to generate or update model elements to reflect the code. 
   ArgoUML supports two types of parsers, one for notation and one for code. 
   ArgoUML does not require parsers for any language, 
   and recognizes that are languages (UML) that are not represented in code. 
   A language which provides a notational parser <strong>must</strong> 
   provide a notational generator. 

   <p> 
   ArgoUML recognizes that a language may have 
   different though basically equivalent 
   representations when displayed 
   in the context of a diagram 
   or when generated as a source file. 
  
   <p> 
   Thus both code and notation are subsets of language. 
  
   <p> 
   Examples for notation: 
   <ul> 
   <li>UML</li> 
   <li>Java-like</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> 
   <ul> 
   Examples for code: 
   <li>Java</li> 
   <li>C++</li> 
   <li>IDL</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> 
   ArgoUML will refer to a notation which is similar to code with the same 
   name that is used to refer to the code itself.  So a notation which 
   is Java-like will be called Java notation. 

 <h3>Package Structure up until March 2004</h3> 
    The different languages or notations 
    supplied with ArgoUML are found 
    in subpackages of {@link org.argouml.language}. 
    Any definition or foundation interfaces are found in the ArgoUML API 
    directory {@link org.argouml.application.api}. 
    Any helper classes such as abstract implementation classes 
    are found in  {@link org.argouml.language.helpers}.
