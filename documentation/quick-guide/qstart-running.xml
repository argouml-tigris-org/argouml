	<title>ArgoUML Principles</title>
	<para>
    When ArgoUML starts, it shows an empty class diagram
    on which you can add various objects. ArgoUML works according the following
    principles:
  </para>

  <section>
    <title>Project, Model and Diagram</title>
    <para>
      The file operations save and open handle one 
      <literal>project</literal> at a
      time. One <literal>project</literal> corresponds to a
      <literal>model</literal> plus diagram information, 
      i.e. everything you can edit within the ArgoUML window. 
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>model</literal> may contain many
      objects (ModelElements) which
      form the complete UML description 
      of the system you are describing.
      All ModelElements might be present on a diagram, 
      but this is not required. 
      Hence, the <literal>model</literal> 
      that is stored in ArgoUML is
      independent of the contents of the diagrams. 
      This may be explained by the possibility 
      to generate programming code from the 
      <literal>model</literal> - you 
      do not need any diagrams for this.
    </para>
    <para>
      An ArgoUML <literal>project</literal> also contains 
      all diagram information, i.e.
      the shapes (presentation) used 
      to represent the various UML ModelElements, 
      their location, color, etc. 
      Some ModelElements appear on multiple diagrams, 
      some on one or none.
    </para>
    <para>
      Hence, saving and opening projects 
      retains all this information. 
      There is a way to only save the 
      <literal>model</literal> information
      though, which is by the menu 
      "Tools" -> "Export as XMI...". 
      This may be usefull e.g. 
      when generating programming code 
      with an external tool 
      that understands XMI.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Objects</title>
    <para>
      Select objects by left-clicking on them.
      The functionality of ArgoUML can be activated in the menu, 
      in toolbars,
      or in pop-up menus when right-clicking above an object.
      Many of these functions work on the selected objects.
    </para>
    <para>
      All diagrams have toolbars at the top which are used 
      to create objects on the diagram.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most objects can be added to a diagram and removed from a diagram without
      deleting it from the <literal>model</literal>! 
      Select an object on a diagram, and then the menu item 
      "Edit" -> "Remove from Diagram" clears the object from the diagram, 
      but the object remains intact in the model, 
      which may be seen in the explorer, 
      i.e. the tree structure at the left hand side.
      Once removed, and item can be added back to the diagram 
      (or any other diagram for that matter)
      by selecting it in the explorer 
      and selecting the item "Add to Diagram" 
      in the right-click pop-up menu. 
      Alternatively, you can drag objects 
      from the explorer and drop them onto a diagram.
    </para>
  </section>

	<section>
		<title>Overview of the window</title>
		<para>
      The top of the window contains a menu bar with commands available.
      In the <literal>File</literal> menu you can store the project or 
      open another project instead.
    </para>
		<para>
      The upper left part of the ArgoUML window shows a tree model 
      of diagrams and objects. 
      This view can be adapted to your needs 
      by filtering the objects that are shown, 
      and the structure in which they are shown.
    </para>
		<para>
      The upper right part of ArgoUML shows the current diagram (one at a time).
      You can drag and drop the objects in the diagrams,
      and you can use the quick-links 
      that appear when hovering over a selected object 
      to create new objects connected to the
      already present objects.
    </para>
		<para>
      The lower right part contains various details of the currently selected 
      object: You select the object in one of the upper
      levels and choose what details you want to examine using the
      tabs.
    </para>
		<para>
      The lower left part contains a list of all ToDo items for this
      model.
    </para>
