		<title>Can your computer run &argo;?</title>		
		<para>
			Before you can install and use &argo; you must ensure that your computer's configuration meets the 
			minimum system requirements for running &argo;. To ensure that your computer can run &argo; properly 
			we will check the following:

		<title>Installation options</title>		
		<para>
			Now that you have a computer that can install and run &argo; effectively, you need to decide which 
			of the installation options available is appropriate for you. You can choose from the following options:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<link linkend="installation-options-webstart">Java Web Start option</link> - this option 
						is provided for first-time or occasional users. It is the easiest and quickest way to 
						start using &argo;
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>						
						<link linkend="installation-options-binarydist">Binary distribution option</link> - this 
						option is provided for regular users. You should also choose this option if you are having 
						problems with the Java Web Start option.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<link linkend="installation-options-sourcedist">Source or CVS distribution option</link> - this 
						option is provided for &argo; developers and contributors. You should choose this option if you 
						are having problems with the other options.
					</para>

				TBD: Using &argo; with JWS
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="installation-options-binarydist">
			<title>Binary distribution option</title>
			<para>
				This is the most common installation option for regular &argo; users. It involves obtaining a copy of 
				the binary distribution archive from the &argo-website; and then preparing your computer to be able to 
				run &argo; using the contents of the binary distribution. You should use this option if you are either 
				unable or unwilling to run the Java Web Start version or, your computer is not directly connected to 
				the internet or, you already have the binary distribution.
			</para>
			<sect3>
				<title>Obtain the &argo; binary distribution</title>
				<para>
					If you haven't already done so, please download a copy of the binary distribution from the 
					&argo-homepage;. If the computer on which &argo; will be installed is not connected to the internet, 
					download the file using another computer and copy the binary distribution file to the target computer.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Create an &argo; installation directory</title>
				<para>
					Create a directory on your computer for the &argo; application. This directory will thereafter be 
					referred to as the <emphasis>&argo; installation directory</emphasis> or just as 
					<envar>ARGOUML_HOME</envar>. Sample commands for creating an &argo; installation directory on 
					computers running Windows and Linux are shown below. You might want to choose a different location for 
					&argo; on your computer.
				</para>
				<example>

				<title>Extract the &argo; files to the installation directory</title>
				<para>
					You will now change the current directory to the &argo; installation directory you have just created and 
					extract the files contained in the binary distribution to the directory. The general 
					form of the command to extract the files is:
				</para>
				<para>
					<computeroutput>jar xvf <replaceable>&argo;-archive-filename</replaceable>
					</computeroutput>
				</para>
				<para>
					As an example, let's say you have an &argo; binary distribution archive named 
					<filename>ArgoUML-0.9.3.zip</filename> that it is stored in a directory called 
					<filename>C:\Distributions</filename> or <filename>~/distributions</filename> on a Windows or Linux 
					computer respectively. To extract the &argo; files from the archive, you would type the following 
					commands on the Windows and Linux/Unix platforms. 
				</para>
				<example>
					<title>Extracting &argo; files from binary distribution</title>
					<programlisting>
chdir <replaceable>C:\OO-Tools\&argo;</replaceable>                                       <co id="install-bin-extract-win"/>
jar xvf <replaceable>C:\Distributions\ArgoUML-0.9.3.zip</replaceable>

cd <replaceable>/usr/bin/&argo;</replaceable>                                             <co id="install-bin-extract-unix"/>

					</calloutlist>
				</example>

				<example>
					<title>Extracting &argo; files from binary distribution</title>
					<para>
						Sample commands for Windows
						<blockquote>
							<programlisting>

							</programlisting>
						</blockquote>
					</para>					
				</example>
				<note>
					<para>
						For the above command to work, the <filename>bin</filename> sub-directory of the JDK directory tree 
						must be added to your <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable. You might also be able to use a compatible 
						de-archiver such as <filename>winzip</filename> or <filename>gzip</filename> to extract the files.
					</para>
				</note>
				<para>
					You should now have the &argo; application's files copied to the installation directory on your system.
				</para>
			</sect3>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="installation-options-sourcedist">
			<title>Source or CVS distribution option</title>
			<para>
				This is the preferred installation option for &argo; developers, contributors and advanced users.
				It involves obtaining the &argo; source code as a distribution from the &argo-website; or from CVS, 
				building &argo; on your computer, and then preparing your computer to run &argo;. 
			</para>
			<para>
				You should use this option if you want to keep up with the latest developments, you are a developer 
				or contributor on the &argo; project or if you have problems using the other installation options. 
				Please note however that the devlopment copy of &argo; is quite often unstable and is not advised 
				for production use.
			</para>
			<sect3>
				<title>Obtain the &argo; source code</title>
				<para>
					You can obtain the &argo-source; via one of two methods:
				</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/v09/ds4.html">Source archive</ulink> 
							- this is a snapshot of the entire &argo; source code that is updated for each release 
							(and maybe at other times too). This is the easiest way to get the &argo; source code 
							but the contents may not be the latest available &argo; source code. You will need to 
							obtain two archive files, one for the &argo; source code and one for the add-ons that 
							&argo; depends on.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectSource">CVS checkout</ulink> 
							- in this case you will extract the latest copy of the &argo; source code from the 
							public CVS database that the &argo-project-link; uses to track the development of &argo; 
							itself. This is really only recommended for developers and other contributors as the 
							latest source code is also the least stable version of &argo;. When you use this method, 
							what you get is always a snapshot of &argo;'s source code as it is being developed.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>
					If you haven't already done so, please please obtain a copy of the &argo-source; here. If the 
					computer on which &argo; will be installed is not connected to the internet, download the file(s) 
					using another computer and copy the file(s) to the target computer.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3>
				<title>Extract the &argo; source code (source archive method only)</title>
				<para>
					If you have chosen to obtain the &argo; source distribution archive(s), you need to extract the files 
					from the archive(s) to a directory on your computer before you can build your copy &argo;.
				</para>
				<para>
					Firstly, create a directory on your computer for the &argo; source code. This directory will 
					thereafter be referred to as the <emphasis>&argo; source directory</emphasis> or just as 
					<envar>ARGOSOURCE_HOME</envar>. Sample commands for creating an &argo; source directory on 
					computers running Windows and Linux are shown below. You might want to choose a different location for 
					&argo; on your computer.
				</para>
				<example>
					<title>Creating a source directory</title>
					<blockquote>						
						<para>
							Sample commands for Windows
							<blockquote>
								<programlisting>
mkdir <replaceable>C:\OO-Tools\&argo;-source</replaceable>
								</programlisting>
							</blockquote>
						</para>
						<para>
							Sample commands for Linux and other Unixes
							<blockquote>
								<programlisting>
md <replaceable>/usr/bin/&argo;-source</replaceable>
								</programlisting>
							</blockquote>
						</para>					
					</blockquote>
				</example>
				<para>
					Next, change the current directory to the &argo; source directory you have just created and 
					extract the files contained in the source distribution archive(s) to the directory. The general 
					form of the command to extract the files is:
				</para>
				<para>
					<computeroutput>jar xvf <replaceable>&argo;-archive-filename</replaceable></computeroutput>
				</para>
				<para>
					As an example, given the following assumption on a Windows computer (with Linux/Unix-specific
					details in brackets):
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								an &argo; source archive named <filename>ArgoUML-0.9.3-src.zip</filename> 
								(<filename>ArgoUML-0.9.3-src.tar.gz</filename> on Linux/Unix)
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								an &argo; add-ons source archive named <filename>ArgoUML-0.9.3-libs.zip</filename> 
								(<filename>ArgoUML-0.9.3-libs.tar.gz</filename> on Linux/Unix)
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								both source archives are stored in the directory <filename>C:\Distributions</filename> 
								(<filename>~/distributions</filename> on Linux/Unix)
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>				
					To extract the files from both archives to the &argo; source directory, you would type the 
					following commands on the Windows and Linux/Unix platforms. 
				</para>
				<example>
					<title>Extracting &argo; files from source distribution</title>
