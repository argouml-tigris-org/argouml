      <para>
When you have done all the work, and all the testing and
are about to commit something please do:
<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Compile argouml 
(<command>build run</command> or <command>build package</command>).
</para>
	    <para>
This goes for all changes, even changes in comments.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
If your changes include removing files make a clean compile.
(<command>build clean</command> followed by
<command>build run</command> or <command>build package</command>).
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
If your changes include removing public or protected operations and
attributes make a clean compile
(<command>build clean</command> followed by
<command>build run</command> or <command>build package</command>).
</para>
	    <para>
The build mechanism does not yet have reliable 
dependancy checker enabled so this is the best way to make sure.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
If your changes include adding abstract operations make a clean compile
(<command>build clean</command> followed by
<command>build run</command> or <command>build package</command>).
</para>
	    <para>
The build mechanism does not yet have reliable 
dependancy checker enabled so this is the best way to make sure.

	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
If you have changed anything that has the potential of affecting
something in a totally different part of the code like internal
data structure, handling of exceptions, 
run all JUnit test cases
and start the tool and do some more testing.
</para>
	    <para>
If in doubt, run all JUnit test cases.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Do a <command>cvs update</command> in src_new to make sure that 
you do not forget to commit any file and to make sure that no one 
else has commited anything in the mean time.
</para>
	    <para>
Remember that if you do not commit all the files from src_new
that <command>cvs update</command> found (marked A, R, and M)
in the same commit then you would better remove those file
from the checked out copy, update to get the original version
from the repository and start over with the compilation.
</para>
	    <para>
If someone else have updated a file 
(<command>cvs update </command> shown U, or no longer pertinent)
please compile again.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Commit all files that are included in a change at the same time.
</para>
	    <para>
This reduces the chance of anyone getting an inconsistant set of files
by updating in the middle of your commit.
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Commit often.
</para>
	    <para>
Remember that the repository is also a backup copy of your work.
</para>
	    <para>
If your change is so big and involves so many files that you would
like to commit it for backup reasons but it doesn't compile or
doesn't work or for some other reason should not confuse the main 
branch in cvs, create a branch to work in.
Then when your work is complete, you merge the branch into 
the main branch.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
</para>
      <para>
<emphasis>Rationale:</emphasis>
These ground rules is for the purpose of not stopping or hindering
the work for anyone.
Remember that there might be several developers working with
different agendas and different efficiency (slower or faster)
and the commits is the melting point of this.
</para>
      <para>
<emphasis>Perspective:</emphasis>
If this will take you an extra two minutes before every commit
remember that if you commit something that will not work this
will take everyone else (guess 10 persons) the extra time of
looking at the compilation error or see the tool crash (1 minute),
wonder why (1 minute),
search for the error in his own changes (3 minutes),
search for the error somewhere else (1 minute),
glance at the mailing list to see if someone else has noticed this 
and send a mail (1 minute),
wait for some response (1 hour wait),
update (1 minute),
compile (1 minute).
This amounts to 10 hours wait and 1,5 hours extra work for
all developers in the project.

Supposing that you have checked out CVS as guest, then after you have
mailed a diff or file to an active developer, and he has entered it in CVS
your checked out copy contains the change but is not in sync and
the next <command>cvs update</command> will result in an merge error.
The simplest way to solve this is to do remove all files modified by you
before doing the <command>cvs update</command>. 
The <command>cvs update</command> will restore all the files from the 
CVS repository and you can start with the next update.

From this point on it is important that you do not reuse your branch for 
any work. Only check it out for the purpose of examining how things were
in the branch. Make sure that all other developers that have been looking
at your branch also knows that it is discontinued.

There are two alternatives:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>

Check out argouml or part of it on that branch:
<command>cvs co -r <replaceable>work_xxxyyy_hisname</replaceable> argouml</command>
		    </para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
Update your copy of argouml to be on that branch:
<command>cvs update -r <replaceable>work_xxxyyy_hisname</replaceable></command>
		    </para>
		    <para>
Make sure that your copy does not have any uncommited code or else your
uncommited code will be present in your checked out copy on the branch.
This could, on the other hand, be useful if you want to test if your uncommited
code works also with the additions on that branch.

      <title>Other CVS comments</title>
      <para>
This is included in the cookbook because it seems that there are
persons within the project that don't have the in-depth knowledge
of CVS nor the interest or need to acquire it.
For that reason some simple questions are answered here 
for use of CVS in the project.
</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Why do I get double lines?
Why do I get ^M at the end of each line?
Why do I get the whole checked out file on a single line?
</para>
	  <para>
CVS is line oriented.
It stores in the repository the concept of a new line
after each line.
It is the CVS clients (the program you have installed on you machine) 
responsibility to convert the conceptual new line to the correct new
line character on your system.
<note>
	      <para>
This is only so for normal files (not marked with -kb in cvs).
</para>
	    </note>
</para>
	  <para>
If files are moved from one system to another or for that matter
checked out on one system and used and edited on another (NFS, SMB, ...)
this is not done correctly.
There could also be CVS clients out there, not doing this correctly. 
</para>
	  <para>
Systems known to the author (Linus Tolke) 
are Unix uses LF, DOS/Windows uses CR-LF,
Mac uses CR.
</para>
	  <para>
Most of the time this really doesn't matter because the editors and
java compiler on all systems are very forgiving.
</para>
	  <para>
There are however some cases when this is cumbersome.
</para>
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>When an editor (or developer) decides to "fix-it".</para>
	      <para>
This means that the editor (or the developer) goes through the file and
removes ^M on every line or something else that touches every line 
in the file.
</para>
	      <para>
This is a problem because the subsequent commit will also touch every
line in the file making that file unmergeable.
This means that every developer that had it modified in a branch or in
a checked out copy will have no help from cvs when doing his merging.
</para>
	      <para>
Remember that you never know what other developers are working with.
</para>
	      <para>
This is fixed by not doing any such fixes and doing a 
<command>cvs diff</command> before
each check in so that your editor has not done this for you.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>When cvs clients and file systems are not in sync</para>
	      <para>
This could result in one of several things. 
Either each line gets an extra empty line when commited,
or the whole file turns out to be on the same line.
</para>
	      <para>
This is the case on several files in the repository at the moment
(August 2002, Linus) and can be cumbersome for the developers.
</para>
	      <para>
These cases should be fixed because the files are no longer
readable.
For the first case, removing every other line (the empty ones)
can in some cases be done without cvs having problems with
merging later on.
For the second case, with a single long line, this will be very
problematic so even though it might cause problems for other
developers it is better to do this as soon as possible.
</para>
	      <para>
When this is fixed, let the fix be the only thing done in that commit.
</para>
	      <para>
To avoid this in the future, always do a 
<command>cvs diff</command> before doing your
change to make sure that only the lines that you have actually
modified will be changed by cvs and not the whole file.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	  <para>
Files that are binary that shall be stored in cvs shall be marked
as binary.
They are marked with the admin flag -kb.
This means that the line ending conversion mechanism will not be applied
on those files and they will be exactly the same on all systems.
This is good for jars, gifs, and other such files.
