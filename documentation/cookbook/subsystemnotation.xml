  <para>
    Purpose - To handle generating, updating and editing 
    in different languages 
    of a textual representation 
    which represents 
    one or more UML modelelements.
    Such a notation element gets e.g. attached to 
    a diagram figure 
    or an explorer entry. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The notation subsystem is located in
    <classname>org.argouml.notation</classname>
    and
    <classname>org.argouml.uml.notation</classname>
    and their sub-folders.

  <para>
    In the scope of issue 3140, 
    the following has been decided about the notation architecture:
  </para>
  <para>
    We decide that we support other languages than UML 
    to show in diagrams, but this
    shall be a user-choice with project scope - 
    and we will never refine the scope
    to something more detailed. 
    Hence we need not store the notationlanguage per Fig.
    
    So, this means that you can set 
    the notation lanuage in the project properties,
    and in the application-wide defaults.
  </para>

  <para>
    The interface NotationProvider is at the center of the subsystem. 
    There is an object implementing the NotationProvider interface 
    per string (i.e. textual model representation) 
    that is shown on the diagram: 
    e.g. TransitionNotation, StateBodyNotation, ModelElementNameNotation. 
    A state will show the latter 2.
  </para>
  <para>
    This notation object would keep track of 
    which UML objects it represents, 
    generate and parse and provide a help text.
  </para>

  <para>
    The Fig refreshes the text by calling 
    the toString() method of the Notationprovider, 
    at initialisation time and
    whenever the model changes. 
    This latter works as follows:
    The notation object defines the set of model change events that 
    the Fig listens at. 
    Putting this task into this Notation class 
    (instead of the Fig) 
    has the advantage that 
    the knowledge to which uml objects to listen 
    is centralised where it is needed, 
    and not any more in the Fig.
    The Fig then receives a PropertyChangeEvent when the model changes.
    This causes the Notationprovider to update the set of listeners, and 
    the Fig refreshes the rendering of its string.
  </para>

      </mediaobject></screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>
    The NotationProvider objects 
    TransitionNotation, StateBodyNotation, etc. 
    are abstract, 
    since they are specialised in classes that implement them 
    for a certain language, i.e. one per language. 
    So, we will have: TransitionNotationUML, TransitionNotationJava, ... etc. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The NotationProviderFactory2 is a singleton, 
    since it is the accesspoint for all Figs to create 
    the textual representation of modelobjects, 
    and since plugin modules can add extra languages.
</para>

  <para>
    The NotationProviderFactory2 creates 
    a notation object 
    on request for any Fig,
    based on the current notation language 
    selected by the user for the current project.
    Hence, when the user changes the language 
    (in the menu),
    then it is the Fig's responsibility
    to listen to the NotationEvent 
    (hence the Fig shall implement 
    ArgoNotationEventListener),
    and ask the NotationProviderFactory2
    to create a new NotationProvider child.
