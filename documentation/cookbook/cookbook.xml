      <para>
ArgoUML is an open source project, so it depends on
people that volunteer to work on it. Especially in the
area of development there is still so much to do!
Everyone who wants to contribute needs to know the
what, where and how to write good quality code, but
getting into it is a big challenge since there are
hundreds of Java files. 
This developer Cookbook is dedicated to all interested programmers and
should help to transfer the knowledge from the old experts to them.
Please feel free to send more questions and/or answers to the 
<ulink url="mailto:dev@argouml.tigris.org">dev mailing list</ulink>!

This document, the ArgoUML Programmers Cookbook, is provided
with the hopes of being helpful for the developers of ArgoUML when
it comes to learning and understanding how ArgoUML work in order
to improve on its functions and features. 

It can also be of interest for persons that wish to analyse the
ArgoUML project for whatever purpose that may be.

     <title>Getting started</title>
      <para>
In order to develop with ArgoUML it is absolutely mandatory to get get
the CVS version of ArgoUML.
How this is done is described in 
<xref endterm="cvs_checkout_term" linkend="cvs_checkout"></xref>.
</para>
     <para>
<indexterm><primary>Libraries</primary><secondary>GEF</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Libraries</primary><secondary>NSUML</secondary></indexterm>
It is also recommended that you check out GEF from <ulink url="http://gef.tigris.org">gef.tigris.org</ulink> because many things in Argo relate to GEF and it is quite handy to have the source code available. Especially since during development cycles new gef libraries to not as frequently get checked into the argouml modules, so it is useful to build the current version for yourself in order to avoid build errors.</para>
     <para>If you want to - but that is really more of a gimmick - get yourself the source of the NSUML library to. But that is not strictly required.
 </para>
      <sect2>
	<title>Which tools do I need to build ArgoUML?</title>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
CVS for obtaining the latest files via internet
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
JDK, at least version 1.2.2 (includes the java compiler)
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
ANT, the Java make tool to manage compiling and packaging.
</para>
	    <para>
This tool is provided when you check out
<filename class="directory">argouml/lib</filename>.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
libs: nsuml.jar, ocl-argo.jar, gef.jar, antlrall.jar
</para>
	    <para>
These tools are also provided when you check out
<filename class="directory">argouml/lib</filename>.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
Since the ant tool and the four libs are provided by in the cvs repository,
a simple 'build package' should be sufficient to compile and build.
</para>
      </sect2>

 </sect1>
    <sect1 id="cvs_checkout">
      <title id="cvs_checkout_term">Download from the cvs repository</title>
      <para>
The cvs repository at Tigris is accessable using the pserver protocol.
The cvs root is <filename>/cvs</filename> at cvs.tigris.org.
You use your Tigris login and Tigris password.
</para>
      <para>
This means that you will set the <varname>CVSROOT</varname>-variable to
<parameter>:pserver:<replaceable>login</replaceable>@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs</parameter>
where <replaceable>login</replaceable> is you Tigris login.
This needs to be done for the first checkout.
After that the root will be remembered by the checked out copy.
</para>
      <para>
The next thing to do is to login. It is done using the command:
<command>cvs login</command>.
This only needs to be done once and then the account on your machine
remembers this.
</para>
      <para>
Then you do the actual checking out.
<command>cvs checkout <replaceable>modulename</replaceable></command>.
</para>
      <para>
The CVS modules you need to check out to build ArgoUML are
<parameter>argouml/lib</parameter> and
<parameter>argouml/src_new</parameter>.
If you don't give a module name all of ArgoUML is checked out.
That is no problem except for the extra use of bandwidth and disk space
but if you have plenty of both, get it all, and eventually you will
see how everything is used for a purpose in the project.
</para>
    </sect1>
 <sect1 id="Build">
     <title id="Build_term">Build Process</title>
     <para>
     The ArgoUML build process is driven by ant, and it is highly recommend that you stick to that. There are people known to build from JBuilder or Netbeans, but always make sure that your work compile with the plain vanilla build process.
     </para>
      <para>
Ant is a tool written in java developed for Apache that reads an xml-file
with rules telling what to compile to what result and what files to include
in what jar-file.
</para>
      <para>
The rule file is named <filename>build.xml</filename>.
There is one of those in every separately built directory
(<filename class="directory">src_new</filename>,
<filename class="directory">documentation</filename>, and
<filename class="directory">modules/<replaceable>whatever</replaceable></filename>).
</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>How ant is run from the ArgoUML development environment</title>
	<para>
For your convenience the ant tool of the correct version is present in the
cvs repository of ArgoUML in the file 
<filename class="libraryfile">argouml/lib/ant.jar</filename>.
</para>
	<para>
Normally ant is started with the command
<command>ant <replaceable>parameter</replaceable></command>
but the ArgoUML cvs repository does not contain that convenience program
so you would instead have to write:
<command>java -Dant.home=<replaceable>/your/checked/out/copy/of/argouml</replaceable> -classpath <replaceable>a:complex:classpath</replaceable> -jar ant.jar <replaceable>parameter</replaceable></command>.
</para>
	<para>
To help you there are instead two scripts (one for Unix and one for
Windows) that are called <filename>build.sh</filename> and
<filename>build.bat</filename> respectively present in most
of the directories that contain a <filename>build.xml</filename> file.
These contain some definitions of classpath to simplify the setup.
All you have to do is to set the variables JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME.
</para>
	<para>
By setting JAVA_HOME to different values you can at different times
build with different versions of jdk and java.
</para>
	<para>
By setting ANT_HOME to different values you can at different times
build with different versions of ant.
This does however not work in the Windows case because of
how <filename>build.bat</filename> is written.
</para>
	<sect3>
	  <title>Compiling for Unix</title>
	  <para>
Here is what you need to do in order to compile and run 
your checked out copy of ArgoUML under Unix.
</para>
	  <orderedlist>

	    <listitem>
	      <para><command>export JAVA_HOME</command></para>
	      <para>
This is for sh-style shells like sh, ksh, zsh and bash. If you use
csh-style shells like csh and tcsh you will instead have to write
<command>setenv JAVA_HOME <replaceable>/where/you/have/installed/jdk</replaceable></command>.

	  <para>
Tigris provides the ArgoUML site to be edited through cvs. Everything
that is checked in under <filename>argouml/www</filename>
becomes immediatly available at the url 
<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/">http://argouml.tigris.org/</ulink>
with some added decorations left and up.
</para>
	  <para>
Example: The file <filename>argouml/www/project.html</filename> is
available at 
<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/project.html">http://argouml.tigris.org/project.html</ulink>.

	  <title>The ArgoUML documentation</title>
	  <para>
For the ArgoUML project the same documenation shall be available in both
html, pdf and javahelp. To this end the documentation is written in
docbook xml and generated into two versions of html 
(one page per chapter and one page for the whole book),
pdf and javahelp.
</para>
	  <para>
We have tools that does the conversion from docbook xml to html and pdf.
The conversion is done whenever you need to look at the result or when 
you want to present the final result on the web site.
</para>
	  <para>
There is currently four different books generated in this way, 
each its own directory. They are cookbook (this document), faq, 
manual and quick-guide. They are all generated and stored in the
exact same way except for the name of the directory that is one
of <filename class="directory">cookbook</filename>,
<filename class="directory">faq</filename>, 
<filename class="directory">manual</filename> or 
<filename class="directory">quick-guide</filename>.
Below I will reference this directory using 
<filename class="directory"><replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>.
</para>
	  <para>
When a new version of the documentation is to be made available on the
web site the responsible document release person does the following:
</para>
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
He checks out an updated copy of everything needed
and a copy of the <filename class="directory">argouml/www</filename>.
</para>
	      <para>
To be on the safe side, this could be the whole of ArgoUML.
</para>
	      <para>
If wanted, the cvs repository could be tagged and then the tag
can be checked out. This makes it possible to know exactly 
how a certain version of the documentation was generated.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
The documentation is generated using <command>build docs</command>.
</para>
	      <para>
This generates all four books and the result appears in 
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/defaulthtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/printablehtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>, and
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/pdf/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>.
</para>
	      <para>
This has been done several times before while preparing the release so
no problems are expected. If there are problems then the preparations
was not good enough and the process is best stopped right here.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
All the old files are removed from the checked out copy of 
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation/defaulthtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>,

The same for <filename class="directory">printablehtml</filename> and 
<filename class="directory">pdf</filename>.

	      <para>
No longer used files in

</para>
	      <para>
The "Unknown" files are scheduled to be added by:
<command>cvs add <replaceable>each of the added files</replaceable></command>
</para>
	      <para>
This removing of missing files and adding of unknown files may seem
backward but it is from the perspective of cvs.
The missing files are the ones that were present in the previous
version of the documentation and that does not have a replacement,
either because that chapter does not exist anymore or that the tool
generate filenames differently.
The Unknown files are files with filenames that for the same reason
appear from one version of the documentation to the next.

	  <title>Tools that does the generation</title>
	  <para>
The tools and templates to do the conversion from docbook xml to html,
pdf, and javahelp are developed by other open source projects and
entered in the ArgoUML cvs repository as a convenience to the developer and
quality responsible of the ArgoUML project.
</para>
	  <para>
The quality responsible is mentioned because 
this makes it possible to afterwards have access to exactly the tool 
that was used to generate a certain version of the documentation.
</para>
	  <para>
When a new release of that tool is provided
and we have decided that we want to move to that version of the tool,
possibly at the same time as doing the necessary tweaks
for that new version in the documentation itself,
the tool is updated in cvs.
This means that ArgoUML cvs only contains released versions of that tool.
If we find an unacceptable bug in any of these tools
we either refrain from moving to that version or 
revert to the previous version of the tool.
</para>
	</sect3>
	<sect3>
	  <title>How developers work with documentation</title>
	  <para>
Developers that work with the documentation or with the tools 
to generate the documentation (or anyone else interested in this)
can generate the documentation like described above and examine
the result in
<filename class="directory">argouml/build</filename>.
It is only the last part about checking in the result under
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation</filename>
that requires write access in the cvs and synchronisation with the
rest of the project.
</para>
	  <para>
In order to do this you need to check out the whole of the
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename> directory.
You also need the directory
<filename class="directory">argouml/lib</filename>
that contains the tools used: ant, Fop, xalan, and more needed to
build the documentation.
</para>
	  <para>
The subdirectories of
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename>
contain.
<filename class="directory">cookbook</filename>,
<filename class="directory">faq</filename>,
<filename class="directory">manual</filename>, and
<filename class="directory">quick-guide</filename>
each contain one of the four books.
The subdirectory
<filename class="directory">docbook-setup</filename>
contains two things. 
It contains the configuration files that control how the generation is done.
It contains the xsl rules for all the generation.
The subdirectory
<filename class="directory">images</filename>
contains all the required pictures for all the books.

      <sect2>
	<title>Troubleshooting the development build</title>
	<sect3>
	  <title>Compiling failed. Any suggestions?</title>
	  <para>
Most compiling problems arise from wrong versions:
ANT or one of the four libs.
This then means that the current version in cvs is not in sync
with itself i.e. some other developer has screwed up.
Look at the
<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/BrowseList?listName=dev">
developers mailing list</ulink> is probably on fire.
</para>
	  <para>
A look on the error messages can help.
</para>
	  <para>
Another reason for problems is an unclean local source tree: if yours
is in doubt, remove it completely and get it all again through CVS.
</para>
	  <para>
Another reason is that you have an .ant.properties or
.argo.ant.properties file that you have been working with earlier
and that is doing something. If in doubt, remove those files.
</para>
	  <para>
If nothing helps, ask the 
<ulink url="mailto:dev@argouml.tigris.org">experts on the mailing list</ulink>!
</para>
	</sect3>
	<sect3>
	  <title>Can't commit my changes?</title>
	  <para>
You need to have a developer role in the ArgoUML project.
</para>
	  <para>
Furthermore the checkout of your copy need to be done with that
developer role. If you for some reason have earlier checked out
a copy as guest and then made modifications, changed the CVSROOT
variable you still cannot modify the repository since the
checked out copy contains information on who checked out. 
The best solution is to always checkout with your developer role.

	<title>Which sources are involved?</title>
	<para>
Relative to the directory org/argouml, they are mainly:
</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
application/Main.java,
</para>
	  </listitem>

	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>What is loaded/initialized?</title>
	<para>
It all begins in org.argouml.application.Main: set up
main application frame (org.argouml.ui.ProjectBrowser), the
project (org.argouml.kernel.Project), numerous classes, and
finally as a background thread: cognitive support
(org.argouml.cognitive.Designer) and some more classes.
</para>
	<para>
The ProjectBrowser initializes the menu, toolbar, status bar
and the four main areas:
navigation pane (org.argouml.ui.NavigatorPane),
editor pane (org.argouml.ui.MultiEditorPane),
to do pane (org.argouml.cognitive.ui.ToDoPane), and
details pane (org.argouml.ui.DetailsPane). Then, the actual
project is set to either a read from file project
(see ArgoParser.SINGLETON.readProject(URL) and
ArgoParser.SINGLETON.getProject() in org.argouml.xml.argo.ArgoParser)
or a newly generated project (see Project.makeEmptyProject()).

      <title>Collaboration table between components</title>
      <para>
Here is a table that lists all components within ArgoUML against each other
so that you easily can find where that specific collaboration is described
(if at all) in this cookbook.
<!--
For the document maintainer:
Please stick to the component names as they are written 
in the entry tags in the header row for links within this document.
They all start with comp-.
Every component has a section describing it at componentname.
Every component has a purpose at componentname-purpose.
Every interface has a description at componentname-to-componentname
(origin-to-destination). Example comp-critics-to-comp-model.

Since the whole module contains a lot of texts describing
things for the user there should be a lot of issues here.
This area is however not clear to the author of 
this part of the Cookbook at this time (Linus Tolke in January 2002).
</para>
	  <para>
From the file above I would guess that the intentions are that
each package org.argouml.<replaceable>x</replaceable>.cognitive
including all subpackages should have the set of classes
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x</replaceable>.cognitive.<replaceable>same x but capitalized</replaceable>CognitiveResourceBundle<replaceable>_ll_RR</replaceable></classname>.
If so I would expect
<classname>org.argouml.cognitive.CognitiveResourceBundle</classname>,
<classname>org.argouml.language.java.cognitive.LanguageJavaCognitiveResourceBundled</classname>,
and
<classname>org.argouml.pattern.cognitive.PatternCognitiveResourceBundled</classname>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>org.argouml.cognitive.critics</para>
	    <para>
These are basic critics, which are very general in nature. For example
ArgoUML keeps nagging when Modelelements overlap, which makes the
Diagram hard to read.
</para>
	    <para>
This package also contain the base classes for the handling.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>org.argouml.uml.cognitive.critics</para>
	    <para>
These are Critics which are directly related to UML issues (well, more
or less). For example, it will nag when a class has two many
operations, because that makes it hard to maintain the particular
class.
</para>
	    <para>
This package also contains Wizards used by these Critiques.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>org.argouml.pattern.cognitive.critics</para>
<para>These are critics related to patterns. Currently they deal only with the Singleton pattern</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>...add a critique?</para>
<para>Your best bet is to look for a critique, which does something similiar and copy what it does. The locations of the critics are mentioned above.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>...fix a critique?</para>
<para>Locate the critique and insert some logging code. You should make sure that you understand all the implications of changes, therefore it is a good idea to see what makes the critic nag in the first place. But rest assured: some of the critics haven't been updated to reflect the latest changes in ArgoUML, so this is a procedure which is well worth digging into, since it gives you also some exposure to related NSUML elements.</para>
</listitem>

	      <para>...write the test in a critique?</para>
	      <para>
This is an idea for refactoring!
</para>
	      <para>
The critiques tests are essentially a combination of conditions 
that are to be fulfilled.
The conditions are often simple tests on simple model elements.
Collect the simple tests as static methods in the class
<classname>CriticsHelper</classname> inte the same package 
as the critique.
Do this moving to <classname>CriticsHelper</classname> at the latest
when you have used the same test in two different Critics.
</para>
	    </listitem>
<listitem><para>...change the text of a critique?</para>
<para>
The texts of the critics should be in the according localization files
and resource bundles. Be careful: in some critics the text is still in
the critic, but if you change that, you will notice that it doesn't
have any effect.

	<title>Which sources are involved?</title>
	<para>
The package org.argouml.uml.reveng is supposed to hold those classes
that are common to all RE packages. At the moment this is the Import
class which is mainly responsible to recognize directories, get their
content and parse every known source file in them. These are only java
files at them moment, but there might be other languages like C++ in
the future. With this concept you could mix several languages within
a project. The DiagramInterface is used to visualize generated NSUML
metamodel objects then.
</para>
	<para>
The package org.argouml.uml.reveng.java holds the Java specific parts
of the current RE code. C++ RE might go to org.argouml.uml.reveng.cc,
or so...
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>How is the grammar of the target language implemented?</title>
	<para>
It's a Antlr (<ulink url="http://www.antlr.org">http://www.antlr.org</ulink>)
grammar, based on the Antlr Java parser
example. The main difference is the missing AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
generation and treeparser. So the original example generates a AST
(a treelike data structure) and then traverses this tree, while the
ArgoUML code parses the source file and generates NSUML objects
directly from the sources. This was done to avoid the memory usage
of an AST and the frequent GC while parsing many source files.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Which model/diagramm elements are generated?</title>
	<para>
The *context classes hold the current context for a package, class
etc. When the required information for a object is available, the
corresponding NSUML object is created and passed to the DiagramInterface
to visualize it.
</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Which layout algorithm is used?</title>
	<para>
The classes in org.argouml.uml.diagram.static_structure.layout.* hold
the Classdiagram layout code. No layout for other diagram types yet.
It's based on a ranking scheme for classes and interfaces. The rank of
a class/interface depends on the total number of (direct or indirect)
superclasses. So if class B extends A (with rank(A)=0), then rank(B)=1.
If C extends B, then rank(C)=2 since it has 2 superclasses A,B. An
implemented interface is treated similar to a extended class. The
objects are placed in rows then, that depend on their rank.
rank(0)=1st row. rank(1) =2nd row (below the 1st one) etc. Example:
</para>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="images/examples/example1.gif" format="GIF"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
	<para>
In the next diagramm, a link goes to a object that is not in the row
above:
</para>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="images/examples/example2.gif" format="GIF"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
	<para>
In this case, insert virtual objects which are linked to the actual
target and link to them:
</para>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="images/examples/example3.gif" format="GIF"/>
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
	<para>
The object are sorted within their row then to minimize crossing links
then. Compute the average value of the vertical positions of all linked
object in the row above. Example: we have 2 ranks 0 and 1 with 3
classes each:
</para>
	<blockquote>
	  <para>
A B C : rank 0
</para>
	  <para>
D E F : rank 1
</para>
	</blockquote>
	<para>
We give the superclasses an index in their rank (assuming that they are
already sorted):
</para>
	<blockquote>
	  <para>
A:0, B:1, C:2
</para>
	</blockquote>
	<para>
D, E, F have the following links (A, B, C could be interfaces, so I allow
links to multiple superclasses here):
</para>
	<blockquote>
	  <para>
D -> C
</para>
	  <para>
E -> A and C
</para>
	  <para>
F -> A and B
</para>
	</blockquote>
	<para>
Compute the average value of the indexes:
</para>
	<blockquote>
	  <para>
D = 2 (C has index 2 / 1 link)
</para>
	  <para>
E = 0 + 2 / 2 = 1 (A=0, C=2 divide by 2 links)
</para>
	  <para>
F = 0 + 1 / 2 = 0.5 (A=0, B=1, 2 links)
</para>
	</blockquote>
	<para>
Then sort the subclasses by that value:
</para>
	<blockquote>
	  <para>
F(is 0.5), E(is 1), D(is 2)
</para>
	</blockquote>
	<para>
So the placement is:
</para>
	<blockquote>
	  <para>
A B C
</para>
	  <para>
(here are the links, but I can't hardly paint them as ASCIIs)
</para>
	  <para>
F E D
</para>
	</blockquote>

      <title>The JUnit module</title>
      <para>
The JUnit module is an ArgoUML module that is used to contain all 
Unit Test Cases.
The reason for it being a module is that the classes contained need
not be distributed with the ArgoUML distribution. 
They have their use in the hands of the developers of ArgoUML.
</para>
      <para>
The module is available from cvs under
<filename class="directory">modules/junit</filename>
and the used version of the JUnit framework is also available there
(under <filename class="directory">modules/junit/lib</filename>).
</para>
      <para>
The Java package structure under 
<filename class="directory">modules/junit/src</filename>
in the module is a complete copy of the ArgoUML Java package
structure.
Ideally every class
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>
stored in the file
<filename class="directory">src_new/org/argouml/<replaceable>x/y</replaceable>/<replaceable>z</replaceable>.java</filename>
should have a JUnit test case called
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.Test<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>
stored in the file
<filename class="directory">modules/junit/src/org/argouml/<replaceable>x/y</replaceable>/Test<replaceable>z</replaceable>.java</filename>
containing all the Unit Test Cases for that class.

</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>How to write a test case</title>
	<para>
Now this will make all you java-enthusiasts go nuts!
We have both classnames and method names that need to have a special
syntax.
</para>
	<para>
The name of the test case starts with "Test" (i.e. Capital T, then
small e, s and t). This is to help the TestAll class determine what is
a Test Case and what is not without loading them. 
If you write a test case that does not comply to this rule you still
can run the test case but it wont be run by TestAll.
This could prove useful sometimes but I (Linus) have yet to figure out
when.
</para>
	<para>
The test case imports the JUnit framework: 
<blockquote>
	    <para>
import junit.framework.*;
</para>
	  </blockquote>
and it inherits <classname>TestCase</classname>.
</para>
	<para>
Methods that are tests must have names that start with "test"
(i.e. all small t, e, s, t). This is a requirement of the JUnit
framework.
</para>
	<para>
A lot of times it is useful just to run the compiler to verify that
the signatures are correct on the interfaces. Therefor Linus has
thought it is a good idea to add methods called
<methodname>compileTestStatics</methodname>,
<methodname>compileTestConstructors</methodname>, and
<methodname>compileTestMethods</methodname>
that was thought to include correct calls to all static methods,
all public constructors, and all other public methods that are not
otherwise tested.
These methods are never called.
They serve as a guarantee that the public interface of a class will
ever loose any of the functionality provided by its signature in an
uncontrolled way in just the same way as the test-methods serve as a
guarantee that no features will ever be lost.
</para>

	  <title>A complete example</title>
	  <para>

package org.argouml.uml.ui;
import junit.framework.*;

public class TestUMLAction extends TestCase {
    public TestUMLAction(String name) {
	super(name);

	assert("Disabled", to.shouldBeEnabled());
    }
    public void testCreate3() {
	UMLAction to = new UMLAction(new String("hejsan"), true, UMLAction.NO_ICON);
	assert("Disabled", to.shouldBeEnabled());
    }
	

    /** Function never actually called. Provided in order to make
     *  sure that the static interface has not changed.
     */
    private void compileTestStatics() {
	boolean t1 = UMLAction.HAS_ICON;
	boolean t2 = UMLAction.NO_ICON;
	UMLAction.getShortcut(new String());
	UMLAction.getMnemonic(new String());
    }

    private void compileTestConstructors() {
	new UMLAction(new String());
	new UMLAction(new String(), true);
	new UMLAction(new String(), true, true);
    }

    private void compileTestMethods() {
	UMLAction to = new UMLAction(new String());
	to.markNeedsSave();
	to.updateEnabled(new Object());
	to.updateEnabled();
	to.shouldBeEnabled();
    }

      <sect2>
	<title>The TestAll class</title>
	<para>
The TestAll class goes through all directories under 
<filename class="directory">modules/junit/build/classes</filename>
and finds all class-files beginning with "Test".
They are all added to the test suite.
</para>
	<para>
This means that the risk of forgetting to add a test case to the suite
is reduced and there is no need to maintain such a suite.
</para>
	<para>
On the other hand this only works in the build environment.
If the jar-file is used somewhere else or the ArgoUML is started in
some other place with respect to
<filename class="directory">modules/junit/build/classes</filename>
then this will fail and TestAll will probably not detect any test
cases at all.
</para>
	<para>
I hope and think that this will never be a problem since most of the
times the test cases are run by a person with all the source available
in just this way.

      <listitem>
	<para>
I am using the 
<programlisting>
import ...*;
</programlisting>
command to keep the code short. 
I prefer to let name conflicts arrise so that I can catch them, rather
than always use explicit package.class names and end up with code that
cannot be changed to the package-name-only style.
(Note: This means that if you make a zip file for use in your
CLASSPATH, you must use a version of the zip tool that includes
directory entries.)
</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
All instance variables are protected and their names begin with an underscore.
If the variable should be accessible then add public or protected
accessor methods with the same name as the variable without the
underscore with "get" or "set" prepended.
For example:
<varname>_lineWidth</varname>, 
<methodname>setLineWidth()</methodname>, and 
<methodname>getLineWidth()</methodname>.
</para>

In general, write short code.
If a method will fit comfortably on one line, then put it on one line.

      <listitem>
	<para>
Use javadoc for each class, instance variable, and method. 
In general do not put comments in the body of a method. 
If you are doing something complex enough to need a comment, consider
breaking it out into its own commented method.

	<para>
Name all classes with an initial uppercase letter, and all variables
and methods with a lowercase one. 
I use the <varname>allTogetherWithCaps</varname> naming style.
Name static variables with an underscore and an inital capital letter,
e.g., <varname>_PossibleLanguages</varname>.
Name constants with all upper case and underscores, e.g., 
<constant>GRIP_MARGIN</constant>.
</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
To emphasize clusters of classes I am using what I call the binomial
naming style (I am sure others have thought of this also): 
The root class of the cluster has a short name (e.g., Layer), 
other members of the cluster use that name as a prefix (e.g., LayerGrid).
This makes many of the class name longer than they might be normally (e.g., Grid would be shorter).
But this provides a lot of context without
having to look at a class inheritance diagram.
It is also very nice when you have to look at an alphabetical list
of classes. I try to name class clusters so that they are not lexigraphically close others (e.g., the Net cluster
used to be named Model, but that lexigraphically overlapped the Mode cluster).

      <para>
Cognitive Support Features for Software Development Tools
</para>
<para>
The dissertation of Jason Robbins is a <emphasis>MUST READ</emphasis> for everyone concerned about ArgoUML. Be careful though, since it is based on an old version of ArgoUML, but many of the concepts remain intact.
</para>
      <sect2>
	<title>Abstract</title>
	<para>
Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Most software
design tools provide support for editing, viewing, storing, sharing,
and transforming designs, but lack support for the essential and
difficult cognitive tasks facing designers. These cognitive tasks
include decision making, decision ordering, and task-specific design
understanding. To date, software design tools have not included
features that specifically address key cognitive needs of designers,
in part, because there has been no practical method for developing and
evaluating these features.
</para>
	<para>
This dissertation contributes a practical description of several
cognitive theories relevant to software design, a method for devising
cognitive support features based on these theories, a basket of
cognitive support features that are demonstrated in the context of a
usable software design tool called Argo/UML, and a reusable
infrastructure for building similar features into other design tools.
Argo/UML is an object-oriented design tool that includes several novel
features that address the identified cognitive needs of software
designers. Each feature is explained with respect to the cognitive
theories that inspired it and the set of features is evaluated with a
combination of heuristic and empirical techniques.

Enhancing a UML Modelling Tool with Context-Based Constraints for Components

Noch vor der Erstellung eines detaillierten Entwurfs hilft ein
Spezifiationmodell eines komponenten-basierten Systems dabei, Probleme
so frh im Entwicklungsproze wie mglich zu entdecken. Die Sprache
CCL ('Component Constraint Language') wurde bei CIS entwickelt und
erlaubt den Entwickler 'Contextbased Constraints' dem
Spezifikationsmodell hinzuzufgen. Dadurch entsteht ein Modell, das
ber die Beschreibung der statische Struktur des Systems
hinausgeht. Zur Zeit existiert allerdings kein Werkzeug, das das
Komponentenspezifikationsmodell in den Entwicklungsproze
integriert. Ziel dieser Diplomarbeit war der Entwurf eines solchen
Werkzeugs, um die Philosophie des Continuous Software Engineering
(CSE) zu untersttzten.

</para>
	<para>
Before starting a detailed design, a specification model of the
component-based system assists the software developer in early problem
detection as soon as possible in the development process. The
Component Constraint Language (CCL) developed at CIS enables the
developer to add context-based constraints (CoCons) to a component
specification model. This produces a model which goes beyond the
simple description of the system's static structure. At this time,
there is no tool to integrate the component specification model into
the development process. The goal of this master's thesis was to
design such a tool, thereby supporting the Continuous Software
Engineering (CSE) philosophy.
