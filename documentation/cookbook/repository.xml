  <para>
This appendix describes what parts of the repository is used for
what purpose.
This is a rather terse collection.
Further details on specific parts can sometimes be found elsewhere in
this document.
</para>

  <note>
    <para>
This explanation only describes the single Tigris project layout.
Lately (since beginning of 2006) we have been working with splitting
the project over several Tigris projects.
This is not yet described here.
</para>
  </note>

  <note>
    <para>
This explanation was first written when it was a CVS repository. 
This repository is then converted to a SVN repository with the exact
same structure so the choice of version control system should not
matter.
However, the descriptions might include the incorrect name of the tool
since this description is unlikely to be updated exactly when the
conversion is done.
</para>
  </note>

  <para>
This chapter is organized as the repository itself and
everything is in alphabetical order.
</para>
  <para>
This is the normal structure for any argouml jar file and project.
</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename>build.xml</filename></para>
      <para>
The file controlling the build of that subsystem.
</para>
      <para>
When built, the result end up in a newly created build directory.
</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">build</filename></para>
      <para>
Directory where the built things end up when building with ant.
</para>
      <para>
This is not kept in the repository. It is created by the build.
For historic reasons this actually exists in the CVS repository
of some of the projects.
This will be fixed after the move to SVN.
</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">build-eclipse</filename></para>
      <para>
Directory where the built things end up when building with Eclipse.
</para>
      <para>
This is not kept in the repository. It is created by the build.
</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">lib</filename></para>
      <para>jar files used by the project.</para>
      <para>
This directory contains the jar files of products that are shipped with
the project i.e. needed to run the project.
For ArgoUML this is things like log4j, gef, ...
</para>
      <para>
These are distributed with ArgoUML and have licenses that allow this.
For clarity the README files and licenses and other distribution
details of each used jar will also be stored in this directory.
(Quick summary: BSD License, Apache License, LGPL are OK, GPL is not.)
Don't forget to arrange for the modules version and license information
to appear when starting ArgoUML and in the About box.
</para>
      <para>
Take care also to make the versions of these libraries explicit,
so as to allow people building from sources to figure out
exact dependencies. Easiest way is to rename the files to
include version informations, the same way as shared
libraries in Unix world: foo-x.y.z.jar, bar-x.y.z.jar,
etc...
</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">src</filename></para>
      <para>
Source code.
</para>
      <para>
This directory contains exactly one java class tree
that is build into exactly one jar file.
</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">tests</filename></para>
      <para>
Source code for JUnit tests of everything that is in the src directory.
See <xref linkend="junittests"/>.
</para>
      <para>
This directory contains exactly one java class tree.
</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">tools</filename></para>
      <para>
Tools used during the build process.
</para>
      <para>
Tools also have the readme files, licenses and other distribution files
stored in this directory in much the same way as the libraries in
<filename class="directory">lib</filename>.
However the requirement on the license is different.
The tools are never distributed with ArgoUML but merely used in the
development of ArgoUML so it is enough to have a license that does not
allow distribution.
(Quick summary: BSD License, Apache license, LGPL, GPL, Freeware are OK.)
</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>


  <para>
Because of they way the Tigris site works there is also the following:
</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">www</filename></para>
      <para>
This is all the static contents of the web site.
</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
For historic reasons the argouml project i.e. the main project
looks a little bit different.
</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">documentation</filename></para>
      <para>Directory where the source of the documentation is.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><filename class="directory">cookbook</filename></para>
          <para>XML-source code for this cookbook.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><filename class="directory">docbook-setup</filename></para>
          <para>
XML Tools and configuration files used for the formatting of
the documentation from the XML-source to HTML and PDF.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><filename class="directory">images</filename></para>
          <para>Pictures for all documents are collected here.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><filename class="directory">javahelp</filename></para>
          <para>Not used. Empty.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>

          <para>XML-source code for the User Manual.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><filename class="directory">quick-guide</filename></para>
          <para>XML-source code for the Quick Guide.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
It is not yet decided how to handle the User Manual in other languages.
It is probably best if they reside in the documentation directory in
the subproject for that language.
That would make the correct group of developers get access to the files
without special features.
</para>

      <para>
Documentation for features and functions provided by other projects
are, for the time being, best kept in the one big User Manual.
</para>
    </listitem>


    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">modules</filename></para>
      <para>Old module structure. To be removed.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">src</filename></para>
      <para>
In conflict with the description above
this directory contains one directory for each subsystem within ArgoUML.
Each directory is a complete tree as described above.
</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><filename class="directory">src_new</filename></para>
      <para>
All source code for ArgoUML including pictures of icons.
</para>
      <para>
This is replacing the <filename class="directory">src</filename> directory
above with the exception that it also contains the build.xml file.
</para>
    </listitem>

  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
The ArgoUML subprojects are projects on Tigris that belong to the
ArgoUML project.
To simplify the administration, they are all set up in the same way, i.e.
as describe above.
</para>
