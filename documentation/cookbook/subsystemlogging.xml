Purpose - to provide an api for debug log and trace messages.
</para>
  <para>
The purpose of debug log and trace messages is:
To provide a mechanism that allows the developer to
enable output of minor events focused on a specific problem area
and
to follow what is going on inside ArgoUML.
</para>
  <para>
The Logging is located in <classname>org.argouml.???</classname>
<warning>This describes an imaginary subsystem.  All ArgoUML code uses 
log4j directly.</warning>
</para>
  <para>
The Logging is a Layer 0 subsystem.
</para>
  <para>
From a strict subsystem point of view,
the logging subsystem should be merged with the JRE subsystem.
The problem is that the JRE subsystem is strange enough as it is
with the fact that it doesn't exist in the source code.
</para>
  <para>
Logging is currently implemented using log4j.
</para>
  <para>
        <application>ArgoUML</application> uses the standard 
        <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</ulink>
        logging facility. The following sections deal with the current
        implementation in <application>ArgoUML</application>. By
        default, logging is turned off and only the version
        information of all used libraries are shown on
        the console.
  </para>
 
  <sect2>
    <title>What to Log in ArgoUML</title>
    <para>
            Logging entries in log4j
            belong to exactly <emphasis>one</emphasis> level.
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
                The FATAL level designates very severe error events that 
                will presumably lead the application to abort.
Everything known about the reasons for the abortion of the application
shall be logged.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
                The ERROR level designates error events that might still 
                allow the application to continue running.
Everything known about the reasons for this error condition shall be
logged.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
                The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.
This is if CG can't find all the information required 
and has to make something up.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
                The INFO level designates informational messages that 
                highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained 
                level.
This typically involves creating modules, subsystems, and singletons,
loading and saving of files, imported files, opening and closing files.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
                The DEBUG Level designates fine-grained informational 
                events that are most useful to debug an application.
This could be everything happening within the application.
</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

            This list is ordered according to the priority of these
            logging entries i.e. if logging on level WARN is enabled
            for a particular class/package,
            all logging entries that belong to the above levels ERROR
            and FATAL are logged as well.
    </para>
    <para>
For performance reasons, it is advised to do a check before 
frequently passed DEBUG
and INFO log4j messages (see <xref linkend="example.log4j.speed"/>).
The purpose of this test is to avoid the creation of the argument.

    <para>
            To make log entries from within your own classes, you just
            need to follow the three steps below:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Import the org.apache.log4j.Logger class</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Get a Logger</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Start Logging...</para></listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <example>
      <title>For log4j version 1.2.x</title>
      <programlisting>
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
...
public class <replaceable>theClass</replaceable> {
...
    private static final Logger LOG = 
        Logger.getLogger(<replaceable>theClass</replaceable>.class);

...

    public void anExample() {
        LOG.debug("This is a debug message.");
        LOG.info("This is a info message.");
        LOG.warn("This is a warning.");
        LOG.error("This is an error.");
        LOG.fatal("This is fatal. The program stops now working...");
    }
            </programlisting>
    </example>
    <para>
Notice that we in the ArgoUML project have decided to have all loggers
private static final with a static initializer.
The reason for making them private is that this reduces the coupling between
classes i.e. there is no risk that one class uses some other class' Logger
to do logging.
The reason for making them static is that our classes are more or less
all either lightweight, like a representation of an object in the
model, or a singleton.
For the lightweight classes, having a reference to a logger object per
object is a burden and for the singleton objects it doesn't care if
the logger is static or not.
The reason for making this final is that it shall never be modified by
the class.
The reason for having a static initializer is that then all classes can
do this in the same way and we don't ever risk to forgot to create the
Logger.
</para>
    <para>
        For performance reasons, a check before the actual logging statement 
        saves the overhead of all the concatenations, data conversions and
        temporary objects that would be created otherwise. Even if logging 
        is turned off for DEBUG and/or INFO level.
    </para>
    <example id="example.log4j.speed">

      <programlisting>
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
        LOG.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
    }
    if (LOG.isInfoEnabled()) {
        LOG.info("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
    }
            </programlisting>
    </example>
    <warning>
      <para>
Since this has a big impact also on the readability, 
only use it where it is really needed 
(like places passed several times per second or hundreds of times
for every key the user presses).

    </para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Reasoning around the performance issues</title>
      <para>
Most of the log statements passed in ArgoUML are passed with logging
turned off.
This means that the only thing log4j should do is to determine that
logging is off and return.
Log4j has a really quick algorithm to determine if logging is on for
a certain level so that is not a problem.
</para>
      <para>
The problem is instead explained by noticing
the following log statement:
            <programlisting>
        int i;
...
        LOG.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
            </programlisting>
It is quite innocent looking isn't it?
Well that is because the java compiler is very helpful 
when it comes to handling strings 
and will convert it to the equivalent of:
            <programlisting>
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        sb.append("Entry number: ");
        sb.append(i);
        sb.append(" is ");
        sb.append(entry[i].toString());
        LOG.debug(sb.toString());
            </programlisting>
If the entry[i] is some object with a lot of calculations 
when toString() is called and the logging statement is passed
often some action needs to be taken.
If the toString() methods are simple you are still 
stuck with the overhead of creating a <classname>StringBuffer</classname>
(and a <classname>String</classname> from the sb.toString()-statement.

            log4j uses the command line parameter
            <parameter>-Dlog4j.configuration = URL</parameter>
            to configure itself where URL points to the location of

      <title>...when running ArgoUML from the command line</title>
      <para>
                There are currently two ways of running
                <application>ArgoUML</application> from the command
                line:
        <orderedlist>

            <para>

</para>
          </listitem>                    
        </orderedlist>

                In the first case, the configuration file is specified
                directly on the command line, whereas in the latter
                case this parameter is specified in the
                <filename>build.xml</filename> (which in that case
                needs to be modified).
                <application>ArgoUML</application> is then started as
