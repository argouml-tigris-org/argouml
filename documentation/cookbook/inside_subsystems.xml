      <title>Common import code</title>
      <para>In late 2006, the source importers were restructured to make them
      GUI independent and move as much functionality as possible to common
      code.  Things such as source file selection and class diagram creation
      which previously had been provided by the specific language importers
      are now provided as common services, simplifying creation of new
      language importers.  These services also include a GUI independent method
      for requesting, saving, and restoring any language-specific settings
      (not fully implemented).</para>

      <title>Diagram layout algorithms</title>
      <para> The classes in
        org.argouml.uml.diagram.static_structure.layout.* hold the Class
        diagram layout code. No layout for other diagram types yet. It's based on a
        ranking scheme for classes and interfaces. The rank of a class/interface
        depends on the total number of (direct or indirect) super-classes. So if
        class B extends A (with rank(A)=0), then rank(B)=1. If C extends B, then
        rank(C)=2 since it has 2 super-classes A,B. An implemented interface is
        treated similar to a extended class. The objects are placed in rows then,
        that depend on their rank. rank(0)=1st row. rank(1) =2nd row (below the
        1st one) etc. Example: </para>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/examples/example1.gif"
            format="GIF"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
      <para> In the next diagram, a link goes to an object that is not in the row
        above: </para>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/examples/example2.gif"
            format="GIF"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
      <para> In this case, insert virtual objects which are linked to the actual
        target and link to them: </para>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/examples/example3.gif"
            format="GIF"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
      <para> The objects are sorted within their row then to minimize crossing
        links between them. Compute the average value of the vertical positions
        of all linked objects in the row above. Example: we have 2 ranks, 0 and 1,
        with 3 classes each: </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para> A B C : rank 0 </para>
        <para> D E F : rank 1 </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para> We give the super-classes an index in their rank (assuming that they
        are already sorted): </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para> A:0, B:1, C:2 </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para> D, E, F have the following links (A, B, C could be interfaces, so I allow
        links to multiple super-classes here): </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para> D -> C </para>
        <para> E -> A and C </para>
        <para> F -> A and B </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para> Compute the average value of the indexes: </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para> D = 2 (C has index 2 / 1 link) </para>
        <para> E = 0 + 2 / 2 = 1 (A=0, C=2 divide by 2 links) </para>
        <para> F = 0 + 1 / 2 = 0.5 (A=0, B=1, 2 links) </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para> Then sort the subclasses by that value: </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para> F(is 0.5), E(is 1), D(is 2) </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para> So the placement is: </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para> A B C </para>
        <para> (here are the links, but I can hardly paint them as ASCIIs) </para>
        <para> F E D </para>

      <title>Which sources are involved?</title>
      <para> The package org.argouml.uml.reveng is supposed to hold those
        classes that are common to all reverse engineering (RE) packages. 
        At the moment this is the Import
        class which is mainly responsible to recognize directories, get their
        content and parse every known source file in them. These are only Java
        files at the moment, but there might be other languages like C++ in the
        future. With this concept you could mix several languages within a
        project. </para>
      <para> The package org.argouml.uml.reveng.java holds the Java specific
        parts of the current RE code. C++ RE might go to
        org.argouml.uml.reveng.cc, or so... </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>How is the grammar of the target language implemented?</title>
      <para> It is an Antlr (<ulink url="http://www.antlr.org">
        http://www.antlr.org</ulink>) grammar, based on the Antlr Java parser
        example. The main difference is that the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
        generation and tree-parser have been removed. The ArgoUML
        code parses the source file and generates Model subsystem objects directly from the
        sources. This was done to avoid the memory usage of an AST and the frequent
        GC while parsing many source files. The disadvantage of this approach is
        that it requires multiple parser passes rather than being able to work
        from the pre-parsed AST.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Which model/diagram elements are generated?</title>
      <para> The *context classes hold the current context for a package, class
        etc. When the required information for an object is available, the
        corresponding Model subsystem object is created.  The collection of
        newly created model elements is returned to the common Import code
        where it can be used to add the elements to a diagram or diagrams
        if the user has so requested.

  <sect1 id="otherlanguages">
    <title>Other source languages (C++, Python, etc)</title>
    <para> Each source language supported by ArgoUML has its own subsystem. They
      are each different in level of support and implementation language.  All
      languages except for Java are in their own dedicated Tigris project with
      separate web site, mailing lists, source repository, etc.  For example,
      the C++ plugin is located <ulink url="http://argouml-cpp.tigris.org/">
      here</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>Currently C++ has no reverse engineering but only code generation (and
      a very simple one at that). The Java classfile module has only reverse 
      engineering.

    <para>There are stubs/shells for many different languages, but the following
    are mature enough to be distributed with ArgoUML: C++ (Cpp), C# (Csharp),

      <para> The Explorer has 3 main subcomponents: a customized JTree, a
        customized TreeModel and an interface for generating child nodes in the
        tree which forms the tree Perspective.
        <orderedlist continuation="restarts" spacing="compact">
          
          <listitem>
            <para> The JTree (org.argouml.ui.explorer.ExplorerTree) has
              been customized to maintain consistent selection state with the
              other model views. It provides a pop up menu (ExplorerPopup) for
              performing actions on specific model elements. There is specific
              functionality in DnDExplorerTree for Drag and drop, and in
              ExportExplorer for copy diagram to clipboard. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> The TreeModel is a customized DefaultTreeModel that listens
              to changes in the UML model. The JTree builds the tree model as the
              user expands nodes, this minimizes the size of the model to those
              part that the user is interested in. The TreeModel contains custom
              DefaultMutableTreeNodes, ExplorerTreeNodes, that maintain
              their own order on child nodes; this will typically be an
              alphabetical order on the model element names. However, it could
              be enhanced to include more powerful orders like total subtree
              size. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> The model uses the third part of the Explorer design,
              PerspectiveRules, to add child nodes to the leaves of the tree. The
              structure of the tree is wholly dependent on the collection of
              PerspectiveRules that together provide a specialized view of the
              UML model. This is very flexible and extensible. The
              org.argouml.ui.explorer.rules package contains a default set
              of PerspectiveRules. </para>

            <para> Obviously it would be possible to add an operation somewhere

            <para>In general you can't. The Explorer tree is lazy in that it only
              explores the parts of the tree that the user has opened. And since
              the GoRules are general navigating to them would require a
              complete tree search. Which is also complicated by the fact that
              the answer is not unique and there can be branches with infinite
              depth. </para>
            <para> In reality it would be possible to create an algorithm to
              search out one occurrence of an element (since the model only
              contains finitely many elements and I assume that no-one will add
              go rules that add branches of infinite length that does not
              infinitely often contain elements from the model), but I don't
              think anyone has don't it. Obviously finding all occurrences
              cannot be done. </para>

                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para> We don't need to search through all modules at every
                    possible point where ArgoUML can be augmented. </para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist> Just as in the old solution, whenever a module
              needs to do something to ArgoUML, there needs to be implemented an
              API, possibly with registration/deregistration and callbacks.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          
          <listitem>
            <para> All modules that can be found are examined at startup. They can
              be enabled and disabled individually from a special available
              modules window but have a default state that applies if the user
              hasn't taken action. Currently the default state is "enabled".
            </para>
          </listitem>
          
          <listitem>
            <para> Dependency between modules! </para>
            <para> If a module cannot be enabled because some other module needs
              to be enabled first or because some part of ArgoUML needs to be
              initialized first this is a problem. This is because the initial
              implementation is such that we have no register of dependencies.
            </para>
            <para> The solution suggested is that the module loader persists in
              its attempts to enable a module so that the order among the modules
              is not important. For this to work the modules needs to signal when
              they fail. This is done by returning false or throwing a Exception
              from the module enabling method. </para>
            <para> The module loader also provides an API that the well-behaving
              modules can use to test if the modules they depend on are enabled.
              The less well-behaving module can just throw an exception when
              they fail to enable themselves properly. </para>
            <para> If a module cannot be disabled, because some other module
              depends on it then this is signaled by returning false from the
              disabling method. </para>
          </listitem>
          
          <listitem>
            <para> Where modules are loaded from? </para>
            <para> The modules are loaded from the same places as in the old module
              loader. They can be internally i.e. available in the core jar file
              of ArgoUML, from the <filename class="directory">
              ext</filename> directory, or if running from JavaWebStart, they
              can be downloaded from the site. </para>
            <para> To reduce the complexity of the downloads, let's use it in the
              simplest possible way: organize each module in a package and a jar
              file, have the jnlp-file list that jar file as a part and a package
              entry listing the classes, have a file listing optional classes
              and a GUI that allows the user to download them. Once a class is
              selected in the GUI it is loaded and, the JavaWebStart class loader
              will guarantee that it is available. </para>
          </listitem>
          
          <listitem>
            <para> The scope of the modules. </para>
            <para> Modules are always enabled and disabled on a per-application
              (per jvm) basis and not on a per-project or per-frame basis.
            </para>

    <para> The OCL is located in <classname>org.argouml.ocl</classname>.

      There are some other helper classes in
      <classname>org.argouml.ocl</classname>, with names beginning with OCL
      but they are used for other purposes. Historically GEF uses OCL as a kind of
      template language to convert the UML diagrams to pgml(and back again), it
      doesn't have anything to do with OCL constraints in your UML model. </para>

Currently this

</para>
    <para> Because of a problem with the interpretation of the UML specification
      and the OCL specification, the implementation of constraints in ArgoUML is
      only possible for Classes, Interfaces and Features (Attributes and
      Operations). See <ulink
