  <title>Standards For Documentation Writing</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
The documentation
      (currently manual, cookbook, and quickguide)
      is written using
      <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook"><application>DocBook
        XML&nbsp;V4.1.2</application></ulink>. This section covers some
      conventions for use of DocBook and for the documentation in general. It
also includes some information 
for tooling configuration, e.g. 
for Emacs with the psgml package.

  <sect1>
    <title>Document Conventions</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
All titles of chapters, sections etc. are capitalized throughout.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
All titles of figures, tables etc. have the first word only capitalized.
</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Spelling is US English.
(According to The Webster's Second Unabridged.)
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Use full URLs throughout all documents!
Rationale: 
These documents may also be published in other formats then 
html on the &argouml; web site.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Do not include lists of what changes have been done to the files.
This information is kept by CVS, the version control tool.
This is changed since Jeremy Bennet did the work for 
the 0.9/0.10 User Manual and there might still exist such lists.
Remove them while changing the files!
</para>
        <para>
The Cookbook has a Change Log 
(See <xref linkend="changelog"/>)
that is updated for every significant
change but that is for the purpose of making it easier for the readers.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
When problems in the current implementation of &argouml; are mentioned
or perhaps even emphasized using the
<sgmltag>warning</sgmltag> tag,
include the issue number in a sgml-comment in the source 
so that it is easy to know if this problem has been fixed
when revising the document.
The issue should be mentioned in the format <quote>issue xxx</quote>, i.e.
there should only be a space between 
the word <quote>issue</quote> 
and the issue number. 
This allows the tigris web site to 
generate links when viewing
the manual source.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
Do not write "currently". Better write either
"in version 0.14" if you mean in the stable version 0.14 of ArgoUML or "in
version &amp;argoversion;" if you mean in the current version of the document
as defined in <filename>default.properties</filename> when 
the document is deployed.
There
are some old references to "current" or "currently" also. If you encounter
them, try to remove them!
        </para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>
For documents that contain an <quote>index</quote>,
Add indexterms while doing changes. 
Creating the index is a good idea 
and we eventually should have indexterms all over. 
Initially, the manual was written without
useing indexterms at all. 
They have been added 
generously on certain parts but that makes the index
strangely biased.
        </para>

        <para>
Capitalize the part of the indexterms that are terms.
</para>

        <para>
Don't use the tertiary level of the index terms but 
use only two alternatives:
Only primary, and primary/secondary.
If you are unsure when to use primary or primary/secondary use
the small word approach.
I.e. if the indexterm contains a small word (typically to, of, for, in)
and normally not capitalized, let the secondary start with that
small word.
</para>

        <para>
When using primary/secondary, see that you get the same kind of
word as used before in the index (especially when it comes to
differences in singular/plural-form).
Also create other indexterm by turning the phrase to as many
permutations that you can think of.
</para>

  <!-- Conventions relating to DocBook -->

  <sect1>
    <title>DocBook Conventions</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
The top level document
of the document
is in <filename>documentname.xml</filename>. 
Each chapter (or
        preface, glossary, appendix etc) is a separate file, defined as a
        system entity and included from this top level
        file.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>There are some useful entities defined for common terms
        in the beginning of 
this top level document.
</para>
        <para>
        E.g. use of
        <sgmltag>&amp;argouml;</sgmltag> will ensure consistent naming of the
product (ArgoUML) and allow us to change it later (to Argo/UML,
        Argouml or whatever).
</para>
        <para>
In the build script there is some magic that
translates @tagname@ to a real value.
E.g. @VERSION@ in the <filename>documentname.xml</filename> file 
into <replaceable>0.16</replaceable>.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>XML comments are used throughout to explain what various
        sections are trying to achieve.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Cross-referencing requires use of <literal>id.</literal>
        attributes. 
        Many of these used in the manual are of the following format, but the
        use of this format is not obligatory any more.</para>
        
        <para>
        To avoid confusion, use
        a prefix of <literal>ch.</literal>
        for <sgmltag>chapter</sgmltag>, <literal>app.</literal> for
        <sgmltag>appendix</sgmltag>, <literal>s.</literal> 
        for <sgmltag>sect1</sgmltag> through
        <sgmltag>sect5</sgmltag>, <literal>fig.</literal> for
        <sgmltag>figure</sgmltag>, <literal>tab.</literal> for
        <sgmltag>table</sgmltag> and <literal>gl</literal> for
        <sgmltag>glossentry</sgmltag>.</para>

        <para>A second prefix of <literal>tut.</literal> or
          <literal>ref.</literal> is allowed
          to distinguish tutorial and reference
          material. The remainder of the tag should be descriptive, but concise
          with words separate by underscore. Where a graphic is involved this
          remainder should correspond to the file name. For example
          <literal>fig.ref.navigation_pane</literal> for a figure showing the
          explorer, with the diagram in
          <literal>navigation_pane.gif</literal></para>

	<para>
There is one exception to this and that is the 
description of the critics in the manual.
Each paragraph about a critic is instead marked with
<literal>critics.</literal> followed by the classname
implementing that critic.
The reason for this is that the intention is to have the manual
accessable when pressing the Help button on that critic.
Generating a link to the correct place in the manual is easier
if the classname need not undergo some kind of textual
transformation and the implementation doesn't
care if a a specific critic is described in a 
<sgmltag>sect1</sgmltag>, 
<sgmltag>sect2</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>sect3</sgmltag>, or
<sgmltag>sect4</sgmltag>.
Reorganizing the manual would otherwise affect also the
java code.
The conversion to the correct tagname or really the correct URL
is currently implemented in the 
<literal>defaultMoreInfoURL()</literal>
method in the
<literal>org.argouml.cognitive.critics.Critic</literal>
class.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Only use <sgmltag>glossterm</sgmltag> (for the term
        <emphasis>or</emphasis> its abbreviation/acronym),
        <sgmltag>glossdef</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>glossseealso</sgmltag>
        within <sgmltag>glossentry</sgmltag>. Other entries are not
        implemented in the style sheets and so do not appear in the
        glossary!</para></listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Use spaces rather than tabs. 
Tabs are generally set so large the text moves over to the right of the page,
and are not set the same everywhere (emacs uses 8 spaces, some MS
editors use 6 spaces), making documents unreadable between users.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <!--listitem>
	<para>
Indent only the tags, not the text.
The Docbook source is kept in CVS that is a line-oriented tool. 
This means that reindentation will be a major thing in CVS making
it hard to see if there were other things done to the code.
Especially if reindentation caused the paragraphs to be broken
in a different way.
Not indenting the text means that the text will be unchanged even
if the heading level was changed.
The contributions that Jeremy Bennet did for the 0.10 User Manual
are not indented like this.
Change it while changing the paragraphs.
</para>
      </listitem-->

      <listitem>
	<para>
    The indentation size is 2.
  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Make a new line after each sentence or before expressions.
The Docbook source is source that is handled by CVS.
When structuring the text the parts are paragraphs, sentences and words.
By having each sentence on a line of its own it is easier to see
what sentences has been changed and what has not in the <literal>diff</literal>
reports from CVS.
The contributions that Jeremy Bennet did for the 0.10 User Manual
are not written like this.
Change it while changing the paragraphs.
</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>All block graphics should be encapsulated within
        <sgmltag>figure</sgmltag>, allowing reference from around the
        text. Set attribute <sgmltag>float</sgmltag> to 1 to allow the figure
        to float (makes life easier for printed version).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>All block graphics should be provided through
        <sgmltag>mediaobject</sgmltag> and provided with both an
        <sgmltag>imageobject</sgmltag> and comprehensive description in a
        <sgmltag>textobject</sgmltag>. This gives the potential of meaningful
        content where a diagram cannot be displayed for any
        reason. Where appropriate the <sgmltag>mediaobject</sgmltag> should be
        wrapped by <sgmltag>screenshot</sgmltag>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Inline graphics can be done through
        <sgmltag>inlinegraphic</sgmltag>, rather
        <sgmltag>inlinemediaobject</sgmltag>. A textual alternative is of
        little value in these circumstances. Where appropriate the
        <sgmltag>mediaobject</sgmltag> should be wrapped by
        <sgmltag>guiicon</sgmltag></para></listitem>

      <!--listitem><para>In general use <sgmltag>literal</sgmltag> for computer
        related text (input and output). There are a huge number of possible
        specialist tags, but I suggest restriction to the following list:
