  <title>Building from source</title>
  <para>
Building ArgoUML from source requires a CVS client, a current JDK (1.4 or later),
and 150MB of free disk space.
All other tools, including the Ant build tool upon which
the build is based, are included in the project source tree.

If you have these tools and are familiar with them, the next section contains
quick instructions to build ArgoUML from source.  For more detailed directions
follow that.
</para>

    <para>
If you are using Eclipse 3.1, see <xref linkend="eclipse3"></xref>
for quick setup instructions.
</para>

    <para>
If you are using Windows, the follow commands will build ArgoUML from source and
run it.  If you using Unix/Linux, the comparable commands modified slightly for
your particular shell will do work.
<programlisting>
C:\Work&gt;set CVSROOT=:pserver:guest@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs
C:\Work&gt;cvs login   (use guest as password)
C:\Work&gt;cvs checkout argouml/src argouml/src_new argouml/tools argouml/lib argouml-mdr
C:\Work&gt;set JAVA_HOME=<replaceable>C:\Programs\jdkwhatever</replaceable>
C:\Work&gt;cd argouml\src_new
C:\Work\argouml\src_new&gt;build run
</programlisting>
A newly compiled ArgoUML will open in a new window.
</para>
    <para>Notes:
      <tip>
	<para>JDK 1.4 or later is required</para>
      </tip>
      <tip>
	<para>
On Windows, the directory path for the JDK installation directory
must not contain any spaces.
<!-- MVW: This is not required, 
at least the statements above work with spaces in the path. -->
</para>
      </tip>
That was the compact version for Windows + JDK.
(Note: JDK cannot be installed in a directory that contains space in its
name. <!-- MVW: idem -->)  
Modifying these steps slightly as appropriate for your shell should
work on Unix/Linux systems as well.

In order to develop with ArgoUML it is absolutely mandatory to get
the CVS version of ArgoUML.
How this is done is described in
<xref endterm="cvs_checkout_term" linkend="cvs_checkout"></xref>.

Notice that the CVS contents is not only a set of source files but
instead it is the complete development environment for

It is also recommended that you check out GEF at the same time as you
check out ArgoUML because many things in Argo relate to GEF and it is
quite handy to have the source code available.
GEF is also residing at Tigris so you can do a simple

      <para>
The CVS repository at Tigris is accessible using the pserver protocol.
The CVS root is <filename>/cvs</filename> at cvs.tigris.org.
You use your Tigris login and Tigris password.
</para>
      <para>
        The first thing you will need to do, is select the CVS client. 
        Most of the description below is about the command line CVS tool, 
        which is available for most operating systems.
      </para>
      <para>
        Whatever tool you use, 
        do not checkout into a directory that contains spaces 
        in a directory name somewhere in the path!
        E.g. <literal>c:\Documents and Settings\...\My Documents\Java Development\</literal> 
        violates this advise 3 times.
        Reason: You can not build the documentation.
        (BTW: Building ArgoUML itself works.)
      </para>
      <para>
        In case you use the command-line CVS client, the above
        means that you will set the <varname>CVSROOT</varname>-variable to
        <parameter>:pserver:<replaceable>login</replaceable>@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs</parameter>
        where <replaceable>login</replaceable> is your Tigris login.
        This needs to be done before the first checkout.
        After that the root will be remembered by the checked out copy.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you use one of the CVS clients with a graphical user interface,
        (like WinCVS, TortoiseCVS, ...),
        or an IDE with a built-in CVS client (like Eclipse or NetBeans)
        then configuration will be done by filling in fields. These fields mean
        the following:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Type: pserver

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>
        If you used the command line CVS client before, then your Tigris password 
        is stored in the file <filename>~/.cvspass</filename>. 
        Some graphical UI CVS clients are
        able to use this password, in others you'll have to enter it again.
      </para>

      <para>
The next thing to do is to login. It is done using the command:
<command>cvs login</command>.
This only needs to be done once and then the account on your machine
remembers this.
</para>
      <para>
Then you do the actual checking out.
<command>cvs checkout <replaceable>directory</replaceable></command>.
</para>

      <para>
The easiest thing to do now, is
just check out the top-level 
<parameter>argouml</parameter> project.  
</para>
<para>This triples the size of the download, 
mainly due to the images in the
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename>
and
<filename class="directory">argouml/www</filename>,
but minimizes the number of separate CVS commands.
<!-- TODO: MVW: Instead of the details above, it is better to advise 
to check out "argouml" completely. 
Describe the details as: "If you want to limit the download size,..." -->
</para>

      <para>Alternatively, if you want to limit the download size,
the CVS repository directories you need to check out to work with ArgoUML are
<filename class="directory">argouml/lib</filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/tools</filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/src_new</filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/src</filename>,
and
<filename class="directory">argouml/tests</filename>.
</para>
      <para>
If you just want to build the documentation you check out the directories
<filename class="directory">argouml/lib</filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/tools</filename>
and
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename>.
</para>
      <para>
If you want to work with the web site you check out 
the corresponding directory
<parameter>argouml/www</parameter>.
</para>

      <para>
If you don't want to acquire a Tigris login to do this you can use the
"guest" account with the password "guest".
Since the checked out copy remembers the login you used to do the
check out, if you do this, you will have to remember to delete this
copy and start over if you get a developer role in the project and
want to do commits directly.

    <para>
The standard ArgoUML build process is driven by Apache Ant, and it is highly recommend
that you stick to that.
Some developers use the integrated build tools of Eclipse and NetBeans, but always
make sure that your work compiles with the standard Ant build process.
There are also some Java files generated by magic scripts in Ant that
you need to create before opening with the IDE.
     </para>
      <para>
Ant is a tool written in Java developed for Apache that reads an XML-file
with rules telling what to compile to what result and what files to include
in what jar-file.
</para>
      <indexterm>
	<primary><filename>build.xml</filename></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
The rule file is named <filename>build.xml</filename>.
There is one of those in every separate build directory
(<filename class="directory">argouml/src_new</filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/src/<replaceable>whatever</replaceable></filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename>, and

For your convenience the ant tool of the correct version is present in the
CVS repository of ArgoUML in the file
<filename class="libraryfile">argouml/tools/ant-1.6.2/lib/ant.jar</filename>.
</para>
	<para>
It is possible to start ant with the command
<command>../tools/ant-1.6.2/bin/ant <replaceable>arg</replaceable></command>
and in the modules
<command>
../../tools/ant-1.6.2/bin/ant <replaceable>arg</replaceable>

On windows the command
<command>..\tools\ant-1.6.2\bin\ant <replaceable>arg</replaceable></command>
runs the program <filename>ant.bat</filename>.
</para>
	<para>
To keep you from having to write this and keeping track if you are
working with a module or not
there are two scripts (one for Unix and one for
Windows) that are called <filename>build.sh</filename> and
<filename>build.bat</filename> respectively present in most
of the directories that contain a <filename>build.xml</filename> file.
These two scripts run the equivalence of the above paths.
</para>
	<para>
By setting JAVA_HOME to different values you can at different times
build with different versions of JDK and Java.
</para>
	<para>
To use different versions of ANT,
you are responsible for installing your own version.
Also, you must execute

Don't change the

Remember that if you do this, you have modified your development

To be sure that you will not break anything for

developed using this modified environment, 
remove these files temporarily for the compiling and testing
you do just before you commit.

If you are in a hurry:
<programlisting>
C:\Work&gt;mkdir argouml\build

Download and unpack the latest release of ArgoUML into this directory.
<programlisting>

      <para>
That was the short version provided that,
you are using Windows + JDK,
you have ant installed, and
the subproject in question does not require any of the ArgoUML tools to build.

      <sect3>
	<title>The sub-project's relation to ArgoUML</title>

	<para>
The purpose of a subproject to ArgoUML is to develop things
that are run within ArgoUML.
In ArgoUML we call them modules,
in other tools they are called add-ins or plug-ins.
</para>

	<para>
If you want to start working with a module of your own you could
do it by letting the ArgoUML project leader set up a subproject to ArgoUML
for you.
The benefits are:
<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>You will inherit all the infrastructure
from the ArgoUML project.
</para>
	      <para>
This includes
a site for your CVS repository, mailing lists, web server...,
a common way to set up the project,
releases,
bug fixes,
Xenofarm builds,
static checks, and
coding guidelines and license.
</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>You get a community of ArgoUML developers
that might monitor your work.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
The draw-backs are:
<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>You are forced to use the ArgoUML infrastructure</para>
	      <para>
CVS, BSD license, coding guidelines.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>You are forced to make your module Open Source.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
</para>

	<para>
If you decide not to make your module a argouml subproject,
you can still benefit from using a similar set up as described here
but since you have your module repository elsewhere,
some adaptations are necessary.
</para>

	<para>
The sub-projects are developed close to the ArgoUML project and
reside in the same CVS repository.
We try to provide a working set of tools and instructions to 
fit the whole set of projects.
These tools are sometimes located in the argouml project and
sometimes in the subproject.

Also, to compile the module, you need the argouml interfaces,
and to run it you need argouml in place.
In most cases the argouml interfaces is argouml itself so this
distinction is mostly formal.
</para>

	<para>
There are two ways to get the argouml in place w.r.t. your module.
The ArgoUML source way and
the quicker ArgoUML distribution way.
</para>
	<para>
Using the ArgoUML source way you check out the argouml project
alongside the subproject you are going to work with and build it.
If you are doing development in the argouml project too,
if the subproject in question requires a tool from the argouml project, or
if your modules is on the bleeding edge of argouml development and you can't
wait for distributions,
this is the preferred way.
You will need to update and rebuild the argouml project regularly.
</para>

	<para>
Using the ArgoUML distribution way, you check out only your module
and then download the ArgoUML distribution and work against that.
This is the approach described in the beginning of this section.
You will need to download and replace the ArgoUML distribution whenever
you need a newer version to work against.
You could also, at any point, upgrade to the ArgoUML source way to get
to the bleeding edge.
</para>

	<para>
The build.xml ant configuration file in the subproject
and the argouml main project
are set up to allow for both of these ways.
</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="working-with-subproject">
	<title>Working in a subproject</title>
	<para>
Each subproject has its own web site with
documentation and plans of the subproject.
</para>
	<para>
The subproject has its own CVS mailing list that you need to join
to monitor the commits.
It also has its own dev mailing list where the people working within
that subproject discusses the subproject.
Join both of these mailing list to see what is going on in the subproject!
</para>
	<para>
The sub-projects don't use their own Issuezilla database but instead they
are subcomponents in the ArgoUML Issuezilla.
Because of this you need to acquire an Observer role in the argouml
project to work in a subproject.
</para>
      </sect3>

	<title>Targets in build.xml in a subproject</title>
	<para>
The following targets have the same documented meaning in all sub-projects:

<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>clean - optional</para>
	      <para>
Removes files that are generated by running any of the other targets.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>compile - optional</para>
	      <para>
Compiles the code.
The result is in <filename>build/classes</filename>.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>generate - optional</para>
	      <para>
This is a step that, if it exists, can be run before compile.
The result of this is some files that is a prerequisite for compile
so the compile target runs this automatically.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>install</para>
	      <para>
This builds the whole module and copies it into the
<filename>ext</filename> directory in the argouml installation.
</para>
	      <para>
The purpose of the ext directory is so that argouml can be started
with several different modules started at once.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>jar - optional</para>
	      <para>
This builds the whole module and puts the resulting jar file(s)
in <filename>build</filename>.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>run</para>
	      <para>
This starts argouml with this module active.
</para>
	      <para>
This is the way to start this module with the newly compiled source.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>tests - optional</para>
	      <para>
This runs all the JUnit test cases available in the module.
This probably requires the <filename>junit.jar</filename> tool
from the argouml project.

Another reason for problems is an unclean local source tree.
This means that if you have updated different parts of your source
tree at different times it might contain inconsistencies.
If you suspect this, first try to fix it by doing
<command>build clean</command> and <command>cvs update -d</command>
before trying to build again.
If that doesn't work remove your checked out copy completely and 
get it all again through CVS.
</para>
	  <para>
Another reason might be that you have an 
<filename>build.properties</filename> or
<filename>argouml.build.properties</filename>
file that you have been working with earlier
and that is doing something. If in doubt, remove those files.

You need to have a developer role in the ArgoUML project.
If you don't then you cannot do commit yourself.
Discuss what you have done and how best to test it on the
<ulink url="mailto:dev@argouml.tigris.org">developers mailing list</ulink>!
Eventually someone will commit it for you.
</para>
	  <para>
Furthermore the checkout of your copy needs to be done with your
Tigris id that has the Developer role.
If you for some reason have earlier checked out
a copy as guest and then made modifications, changed the CVSROOT
variable you still cannot commit changes done in the repository since the
checked out copy contains information on who checked out.
For this reason, it is best to apply for an Observer role in 
the project if you are going to work with the source at all.
The Observer role is probably granted within a couple of days
(we welcome everybody!) and then you can check out with your Tigris id.
This means that when you eventually are granted a Developer role you
can continue working with the same checked out copy.

          <sect3><title>About the Test case Class</title>
  	  <para>
The name of the test case class starts with "Test" (i.e. Capital T, then
small e, s and t) or 
"GUITest" (i.e. Capital G, U, I, T then small e, s, t).
The reason for this is that the special targets in
<filename>src_new/build.xml</filename>
search for test case classes with these names.
If you write a test case class that does not comply to this rule, you still
can run the test cases in this class manually 
by starting with
<command>build run-with-test-panel</command>,
but it wont be known and run by other developers and automatic build
mechanisms so don't do it.
</para>

	<para>
Test case classes that don't require GUI components in place
have filenames like
<filename>Test<replaceable>*</replaceable>.java</filename>.
They must be able to run on a headless system.
To make sure that this works, always run your newly developed
test cases with <command>build tests</command> using 
JDK 1.4 or later.
</para>
      <para>
Test case classes that do require GUI components in place
have filenames like
<filename>GUITest<replaceable>*</replaceable>.java</filename>.
</para>
      <para>
We should try to get as many tests from a GUITest* class to 
the corresponding Test* class because the latter are run by automatic 
builds regularly.
</para>
      <para>
Every class
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>
stored in the file
<filename class="directory">src_new/org/argouml/<replaceable>x/y</replaceable>/<replaceable>z</replaceable>.java</filename>
should have a JUnit test case class called
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.Test<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>
stored in the file
<filename class="directory">tests/org/argouml/<replaceable>x/y</replaceable>/Test<replaceable>z</replaceable>.java</filename>
containing all the Unit Test Cases for that class
that don't need the GUI components to run.
Tests that 
do need GUI components to run should be part of a class named
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.GUITest<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>
stored in the file
<filename class="directory">tests/org/argouml/<replaceable>x/y</replaceable>/GUITest<replaceable>z</replaceable>.java</filename>
</para>
	  <para>
If you only want to run your newly written test cases and not
all the test cases, you could start with the command
<command>build run-with-test-panel</command>
and give the class name of your test case like
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.Test<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>
or
<classname>org.argouml.<replaceable>x.y</replaceable>.GUITest<replaceable>z</replaceable></classname>.
You will then get the output in the window.
You could run all tests in this way by specifying the special test suite
<classname>org.argouml.util.DoAllTests</classname>
in the same way.
</para>

	  <para>
Every test case class imports the JUnit framework: 
<blockquote>
	      <para>
import junit.framework.*;

	    </blockquote>
and it inherits <classname>TestCase</classname>
(i.e. <classname>junit.framework.TestCase</classname>).
</para>
    </sect3>
    <sect3><title>About the Test case Method</title>
	  <para>
Methods that are tests must have names that start with "test"
(i.e. all small t, e, s, t). This is a requirement of the JUnit
framework.
</para>
	  <para>
Try to keep the test cases as short as possible.
There is no need in cluttering them up just to beautify the output.
Prefer
<programlisting>
// Example from JUnit FAQ
public void testIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionNotRaised()
        throws IndexOutOfBoundsException {
    ArrayList emptyList = new ArrayList();
    Object o = emptyList.get(0);
}
</programlisting>
over
<programlisting>
public void testIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionNotRaised() {
    try {
        ArrayList emptyList = new ArrayList();
        Object o = emptyList.get(0);
    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException iobe) {
        fail("Index out of bounds exception was thrown.");
    }
}
</programlisting>
because the code is shorter, easier to maintain and you get a better
error message from the JUnit framework.
</para>
	  <para>
A lot of times it is useful just to run the compiler to verify that
the signatures are correct on the interfaces. Therefor Linus has
thought it is a good idea to add methods called
<methodname>compileTestStatics</methodname>,
<methodname>compileTestConstructors</methodname>, and
<methodname>compileTestMethods</methodname>
that was thought to include correct calls to all static methods,
all public constructors, and all other public methods that are not
otherwise tested.
These methods are never called.
They serve as a guarantee that the public interface of a class will
never lose any of the functionality provided by its signature in an
uncontrolled way in just the same way as the test-methods serve as a
guarantee that no features will ever be lost.

      <title>Manual Test Cases</title>
      <para>
The manual test cases are here to help us test ArgoUML in order to 
cover things that are not testable with the JUnit test cases.
Since it is a little bit more cumbersome to run them, 
a tester must 
read the test cases, 
understand what he is supposed to do,
do it, and
document the result,
we try to go as far as possible with the JUnit test cases
and have as few manual test cases as possible.
I.e. If one of these tests can be converted into a JUnit test case
we shall try to do so because it can save us a lot of time.
On the other hand, 
there are several things that cannot possibly be tested with JUnit tests,
so there probably are a lot of Manual Test Cases to be written.
</para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Running the manual tests</title>
        <para>
Anyone can run the manual tests on any version of ArgoUML.
If it doesn't work, i.e. the expected result is not seen,
then this is a defect in that version of ArgoUML and should
be reported using Issuezilla.
</para>
        <para>
At every release, 
the ambition is to run through all manual tests.
Initially, when the amount of manual tests is small, 
this is done by the release responsible while testing the newly compiled
release.
Later on,
when the amount of manual tests makes it unpractical
to this during the release work,
the work can be done by anyone,
or any group of people within the project,
after a development release is made and before a stable release is made.
A signed statement with list of run tests including version number,
a list (hopefully empty) of failed tests 
together with their Issuezilla DEFECT number,
the host type, OS, JDK version, ArgoUML version, ...
shall be mailed to the dev list when these tests are completed.
</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Writing the manual tests</title>
        <para>
Adding a new manual test to the group of already existing manual tests
or improving one of the existing tests helps the project forward.
Remember that the first priority is to test things with the JUnit
tests because they can be, to some extent, run automatically and
have their result reported automatically but then manual tests
are the next big improvement.
</para>
        <para>
Every test has several attributes to make sure that we can identify
the test and help the developers and testers.

For the ArgoUML project the same documentation shall be available in both
HTML, PDF and JavaHelp. To this end the documentation is written in
DocBook XML and generated into two versions of HTML 
(one page per chapter and one page for the whole book),
PDF and JavaHelp.
</para>
      <para>
We have tools that does the conversion from DocBook XML to HTML and PDF.
The conversion is done whenever you need to look at the result or when 
you want to present the final result on the web site.
</para>
      <para>
There are currently three different books generated in this way,
each into its own directory. They are cookbook (this document), 
manual and quick-guide. They are all generated and stored in the
exact same way except for the name of the directory that is one
of <filename class="directory">cookbook</filename>,
<filename class="directory">manual</filename> or 
<filename class="directory">quick-guide</filename>.
Below I will reference these directories using
<filename class="directory"><replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>.

When a new version of the documentation is to be made available on the
web site the responsible document release person does the following:

He checks out everything needed
and a copy of the <filename class="directory">argouml/www</filename>.

If wanted, the CVS repository could be tagged and then the tag
can be checked out. This makes it possible to know exactly

</para>
	  <para>
This removing of missing files and adding of unknown files may seem
backward but it is from the perspective of CVS.
The missing files are the ones that were present in the previous
version of the documentation and do not have a replacement,
either because that chapter does not exist anymore or that the tool
generates filenames differently.
The Unknown files are files with filenames that for the same reason
appear from one version of the documentation to the next.

      <para>
The developers or authors that work with the documentation or with the tools 
to generate the documentation (or anyone else interested in how it works)
can generate the documentation like described above and examine
the result in
<filename class="directory">argouml/build</filename>.
It is only the last part about checking in and uploading the result
under
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation</filename>
that requires write access in the CVS and 
some configuration management since it more or less is
releasing the manual.
</para>
      <para>
In order to do this you need to check out the whole of the
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename> directory.
You also need the directory
<filename class="directory">argouml/lib</filename> and
<filename class="directory">argouml/tools</filename>
that contain the tools used: Ant, FOP, Saxon, ...
</para>
      <para>
The subdirectories of
<filename class="directory">argouml/documentation</filename>,
<filename class="directory">cookbook</filename>,
<filename class="directory">manual</filename>, and
<filename class="directory">quick-guide</filename>
each contain one of the three books.
The subdirectory
<filename class="directory">docbook-setup</filename>
contains two things. 
It contains the configuration files that control how the generation is done.
It contains the XSL rules for all the generation.
The subdirectory
<filename class="directory">images</filename>
contains all the required pictures for all the books.
</para>
      <para>
When, in the <filename class="directory">documentation</filename> you run
<command>./build.sh defaulthtml</command> or one of the other targets that
builds the documentation,
all books are built.
What happens is (the target internal-dispatcher):

you open the file

and edit the unsubstituted file.
The differences between the unsubstituted file and the substituted file
are so small that it shouldn't make any difference.

other <filename>build.xml</filename> files.
The plan for the future is that the <filename>build.xml</filename>
files contain rules on how to compile and package things into jar files.
After that the
<filename>argouml/tools/bin/build-release.sh</filename> and
<filename>argouml/tools/bin/pack-release.sh</filename>
will be taken care of
signing,
packing into tar, zipped archives, packing sources, and
uploading.

The <filename>build.xml</filename> will have rules that places the
complete runnable release in
<filename class="directory">argouml/build</filename>.
These are the same rules used by developers when compiling for testing.
The
<filename>build-release.sh</filename> and
<filename>pack-release.sh</filename>
script takes it from there.
