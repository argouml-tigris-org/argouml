  <title>ArgoUML Design, The Big Picture</title>
  <indexterm>

  <para> Currently this is more of a base for discussion and ambition but hopefully
    this will mature and prove useful. </para>

    <primary>subsystem</primary> </indexterm> <indexterm>
    <primary>component</primary> </indexterm>
  <para> The code within ArgoUML is separated into subsystems that each have a few
    responsibilities. </para>
  <para> In Issuezilla each subsystem has its issues sorted in a subcomponent with
    the same name as the subsystem. Furthermore the Diagrams subsystem has a set of
    subcomponents for issues connected to the specific diagrams. </para>
  <para> This chapter gives an overall picture with a list of subsystems, their
    dependencies, and their main responsibility. <xref
      linkend="inside_subsystems"></xref> explains each subsystem in
    detail. </para>
  
  <para> The subsystems are organized in layers. The purpose of the layers is to
    make it easy to see in what direction the dependencies are and thus allow us to
    know what dependencies are to be removed in the cases where we have circular
    dependencies. This will also allow us to know which other subsystems are
    involved when testing a subsystem. </para>
  
  <sect1 id="subsystems_definition">
    <title>Definition of subsystem</title>
    <para> All ArgoUML code is organized in subsystems. </para>
    <para> Each subsystem has:

        <listitem>
          <para>A single directory/Java package where it resides</para>
          <para> Subparts of the subsystem can reside in subdirectories of this
            directory. Auxiliary parts, implemented in other products, of the
            subsystems can reside somewhere else. Notice that each other
            product used by ArgoUML is, in the design, located within one of the
            existing subsystems. This means that a change of version or indeed a
            change of choice of such a dependency is an internal matter for the
            subsystem and should ideally not affect any other subsystem.

          <para> All public and protected methods of all public and protected

It should also document the design of the subsystem.
This is in subsections.

          <para>
The Facade class is called
<classname><replaceable>SubsystemName</replaceable>Facade</classname> 
and is located in the subsystem package. 
How it is used is primarily documented in the class file itself (as javadoc)
but the more complex picture is documented in the Cookbook (in

    <title>Relationship of the subsystems</title>
    
    <para> Each subsystem that is used by other subsystems provide two ways for
      other subsystems to use them:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para> The Facade class </para>
          <para> The use of Facade class is not wide spread in ArgoUML. This is
            because ArgoUML is traditionally built as a whole and no subsystems
            were clearly defined. </para>
          <para>
A Facade class provides the most common functions other subsystems want to do 
when using that subsystem to reduce the need of having to use anything else 
but the Facade class. 
The Facade class should be very much more stable than the subsystem itself. 
Methods in the Facade should change very slowly and only be removed after
several months (and one stable release) of deprecation. 
          </para>
          <para> The Facade class is documented in the class file itself (as
            javadoc) and the more complex picture (if needed) is documented in
            the Cookbook (in <xref linkend="inside_subsystems"></xref>).
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> An API with calls to public or protected methods. </para>
          <para> Traditionally, the subsystems in ArgoUML communicate through
            public methods and public variables and the subsystems, as defined
            by the responsibilities, are spread over several packages setting
            aside the Java visibility rules. For this reason it is not well-known
            or documented what public methods form part of a subsystem's API and
            what public methods are internal to a subsystem. For this reason,
            always exercise extreme caution when changing the signature of a
            public method. (See <xref linkend="groundrules"></xref>.)
          </para>
          <para> In order to improve things, make it very clear when encountering
            and understanding the purpose of a public method or class, if it is
            part of the subsystem's API or not (by improving the javadoc for that
            method or class). </para>
          <para> Try to help in moving the public API methods and classes from
            wherever, to the subsystem's directory/package using the proper
            deprecation procedure. </para>
          <para> In order not to worsen things, always add new API classes and
            methods in the subsystem's directory/package. </para>
          <para> This way of communicating is still to be used when it is not
            convenient to use the Facade for a specific use of that subsystem.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist> Notice that the Facade is normally a part of the API or a
      simplified version of the API. </para>
    <para> For each subsystem X in ArgoUML that uses the subsystem Y, the designer
      of the subsystem X must decide if he wants to use the API of Y when using the
      subsystem Y (putting a set of import org.argouml.Y.internals.blabla.*;
      statements in each file of subsystem X that uses subsystem Y) or use the
      Facade class of subsystem Y (putting only one import
      org.argouml.Y.YFacade; in each file in the subsystem X that uses subsystem
      Y). </para>
    <para> 
The API solution makes subsystem X depend on subsystem Y
meaning that when we change the API of the subsystem Y we must also change
subsystem X. 
The facade calls solution doesn't make the subsystem X
depend on the API of subsystem Y but just the Facade of subsystem Y.
    </para>
    <para> The choice between the usage of the API or the Facade shall be stated in
      the Cookbook's description of subsystem X in the list of used subsystems.

    <para> These subsystems are in fact imported libraries

      Not all imported libraries belong to this layer.
      Some imported libraries that only affect parts of the system,
