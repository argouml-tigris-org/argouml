    <title>Terminology in the ArgoUML project</title>

    <para>
This is the Terminology for the ArgoUML project and also for the ArgoUML
product.
The purpose is to establish a common use of some words to make it easier
to understand what we are talking about.
</para>

    <para>
The terminology here is used for:
</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>All code (class names, variable names, method names)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>All comments throughout the code</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
All strings in the user interface (in the default language en_US)
</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>All documents (in the default language en_US)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
All postings to the mailing lists and all other discussions within 
the ArgoUML project.
</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Add</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Add existing object to something.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Code Generation / Reverse Engineering</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Code Generation and Reverse Engineering are the processes of converting 
between the ArgoUML UML model and program code
in a certain programming language.
ArgoUML supports different languages 
such as Java, C++ and PHP for Code Generation and Reverse Engineering, 
but both are not supported for all languages equally.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Delete</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Usually used as "Delete from Model". 
The object will be destructed, and will 
not be present any more on any diagram, nor in the model. 
Additionally, all objects that can not exist without the deleted object 
are deleted from the model, too. 
E.g. deleting a class also deletes all its associations.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Dependency</glossterm>
      <glossdef>

        <para>
A piece of software that is developed by someone outside of the
ArgoUML project and that the ArgoUML project is not responsible for.
</para>
        <para>
The ArgoUML product, like almost any other software project, 
use dependencies so that we don't have to do everything ourselves.
Examples: JDK, NSUML, GEF, log4j, ...
</para>

        <para>
Dependencies were previously called subproducts.
</para>
        <indexterm>
          <primary>subproducts</primary>
        </indexterm>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Export</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Export everything or some part from an existing structure to some format.
This implies some kind of conversion involved.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Import</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Import some other format into an existing structure.
This implies that there is some kind of conversion involved and that
the already existing things are not removed.
They are either changed or left unchanged by the import.
An Export, New, Import cycle can lead to information loss because
of the two conversions involved.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Library</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
A part of a <emphasis>dependency</emphasis> that is installed and handled as 
a unit in the ArgoUML building and installation set-up.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Module</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
A piece of software that is to be loaded into ArgoUML by the Module Loader.
</para>
        <para>
Modules traditionally use the Plug-in interfaces and are for that
reason also known as Plug-ins.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>New</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Create a new project or object.
How does this relate to the Java GUI standards?
(Don't use Create or Add)
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Notation</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Notation is the textual representation of model fragments 
on a diagram. ArgoUML supports Notation 
in different languages such as UML and Java.
Notation may be not only pure text: e.g. UML attributes/operations 
have graphical text properties (underlining, italics) 
with a semantic relevance. To be shown on a diagram, the text has to be 
created by a generator, 
and when the user edits
the text on the diagram, a parser processes the text, 
and adapts the model accordingly.
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Open</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Open an existing project or saved file.
How does this relate to the Java GUI standards?
(Don't use Load, Read, or Import for this).
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Remove</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Usually used as "Remove from Diagram". The object that will be removed is
not deleted from the model, i.e. it still exists, but is simply not present
any more on the current diagram. It might still be present on other diagrams,
or not, but it is surely present in the explorer.
Additionally, all objects that cannot be drawn without the removed object,
are removed from the diagram, too. E.g. removing a class also removes all
its associations.
Once removed, an object can be "added" to a diagram (again).
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry>
      <glossterm>Save</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>
Save the existing project to a file.
The Save operation saves everything (it is a no-loss operation).
A Save, Open cycle does not loose any information.
(Don't use Export, or Write for this).
</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>
