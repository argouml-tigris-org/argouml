  <para>
Purpose - To package and unpackage the
persistence data from different subsystems to and from some storage medium.
</para>
  <para>
The Persistence subsystem is located in
<classname>org.argouml.persistence</classname>.
</para>

  <para>
Currently the storage medium is
a flat file (.uml - xml format) or
a zipped file (.zargo - zip format)
</para>

  <para>
During save the persistence subsystem requests each subsystem for its
persistence data and adds that data to output it is collating.
</para>

  <para>
During load the persistence subsystem unwraps the persistence data and passes
these to the relevant subsystems for those subsystems to build themselves.
</para>

  <para>Edges and nodes are now saved and loaded in z order.
Previously, edges were connected as they were loaded, 
and if the node had not already been read then this was a problem.
We now load all nodes and edges (unconnected) 
and then connect the edges post load.
