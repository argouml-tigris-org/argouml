      <para>
The roles described below are per issue, i.e. for every issue, there
is at least a reporter, a resolver and a verifier.

Hence, each person involved in issues for the ArgoUML project can -
at the same time - have different roles, and consequently, has 
issues to report, 
issues to close, 
issues to resolve, and 
issues to verify.
</para>

      <sect2 id="rolereporter">
        <title>The Reporter</title>
	<para>
The Reporter is the person who enters the issue in Issuezilla.
</para>

Skills:
The reporter is an ArgoUML user, should not need any knowledge of what the
ArgoUML project is actually doing.

The address to enter new issues is: 
<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi">

For entering new issues, registering (as described in 1.3) 
is not required.

	      <para>
Answer clarification requests
</para>
              <para>
Occasionally, the developers of ArgoUML need to request
the Reporter more information, to be able to solve the issue correctly.
Another way of putting it is to say that 
if the issue was reported without some vital information
the Reporter has some more work to do.
</para>
	    </listitem>
            <listitem>

Close the issue
</para>
              <para>
This applies to an issue that is in verified state only.
At the end of processing the issue, 
the reporter has the final word: 
he can check the result, 
and if he agrees with the solution, 
close the issue himself.
Closing an issue requires at least "observer" role
in the ArgoUML project.

This applies to an issue that is in verified state only.
The reporter has the final word:
he can check the result,

he can reopen the issue himself.
Reopening an issue requires at least "observer" role

      <sect2 id="roleresolver">
        <title>The Resolver</title>
        <para>
The Resolver is the software developer who attempts to resolve the issue.
Doing so requires at least "observer" role.
The "developer" role is only needed to commit things into CVS
(e.g. submit changed Java code, scripts or documentation).
</para>
        <para>
Remark: Someone who does not have the developer role, 
but solves the issue and convinces someone else to commit the solution, 
is still the Resolver even though he cannot commit things into CVS.
</para>
        <para>
The goal of the Resolver is to progress the issue to the status of
"Resolved".
The resolver may be the same person as the reporter.

Responsibilities:
          <itemizedlist>

              <para>
Decide usefulness 
(if this issue is really a bug or enhancement and if it is worth solving)
</para>
        <para>
The Resolver has to decide if solving the issue is 
really a useful improvement for ArgoUML.
The Reporter of the issue may very well be mistaken
in entering a bug-issue for what is in fact a feature,
or entering an enhancement-issue which is not really an enhancement.
Another thing that could be is a bug that appears in 
very exceptional circumstances and that
may have large impact on ArgoUML architecture.
If the Resolver decides after the investigation that this bug
is really not that important or that he is not the right person
to solve it he enters his findings as a comment and
assigns the issue back to anyone (issues@argouml) and
moves along to work on another issue instead.

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
If applicable, program and test a solution
</para>
	      <para>
As this might take considerable time it might be a good idea
of the Resolver to assign the issue to himself to reserve the issue.
He can also signal progress by setting the issue to the state Started.

When the resolver is finished with the issue, 
he puts it in "Resolved" status, and indicates the
"resolution" is Fixed, Worksforme, Invalid, Wontfix, or Duplicate.

The resolver needs to know a lot of the insides of the ArgoUML code, Java,
coding standards, and also the current status of the project with goals,
requirements and release plans.

      <sect2 id="roleverifier">
        <title>The Verifier</title>
	<para>
The Verifier may be neither the Reporter, nor the Resolver of the issue.
The task of the Verifier is to check the quality of the solution by
confirming that the solution is complete, to the point, bug-free, etc.
This is an important part of the quality assurance work we do
in the ArgoUML project and the object is to make sure that a resolved
issue is in fact resolved.
</para>

The test must be done on the "Target Milestone" version of the issue,

and your own abilities and time available was incorrect,
then change the Target Milestone of the Issue to another one
that fits your new estimation.
This is just a change of plan.
</para>
	  <para>
If you, at this point, feel that your personal plans have changed
so that you won't have time to pursue the work,
change the Issue back to "NEW" with your experiences sofar
stated in the comment.
This means that you are giving up and giving the Issue back to
anyone.
You should also assign it back to issues@argouml or if you know
someone else in the ArgoUML team that will continue the work,
assign it to him.
Remember not to commit your changes in the main branch but please
commit your changes (if any) into a work branch and state the name
of the branch in the issue.
That will make it possible for someone to make use of your work so far.

the importance of the issues fixed,
the amount of work needed to fit the new version of the subproduct

the planned releases of the subproduct with other issues promised

and
the current release plan of ArgoUML.
