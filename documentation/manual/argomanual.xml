    <title>Preface</title>

    <indexterm><primary>Design</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Designers 
    must manually enter designs, but the primary difficulty is 
    decision-making rather than data-entry. If designers improved their 
    decision-making capabilities, it would result in better 
    designs.</para>

    <para>Current CASE tools provide automation and graphical user 
    interfaces that reduce the manual work of entering a design and 
    transforming a design into code. They aid designers in 
    decision-making mainly by providing visualization of design 
    diagrams and simple syntactic checks. Also many CASE tools provide 
    substantial benefits in the area of version control and concurrent 
    design mechanisms. One area of design support that has been not 
    been well supported is analysis of design decisions.</para>

    <para>Current CASE tools are usable in that they provide a GUI that 
    allows designers to access all the features provided by the tool. 
    And they support the design process in that they allow the designer 
    to enter diagrams in the style of popular design methodologies. But 
    they typically do not provide process support to guide the designer 
    through the design task. Instead, designers typically start with a 
    blank page and must remember to cover every aspect of the 
    design.</para>

    <para>

      ArgoUML is a domain-oriented design environment that provides 
      cognitive support of object-oriented design. ArgoUML provides 
      some of the same automation features of a commercial CASE tool, 
      but it focuses on features that support the cognitive needs of 
      designers. These cognitive needs are described by three cognitive 
      theories:

    <para>ArgoUML is based directly on the UML 1.4 specification. The
    core model repository is an implementation of the Java Metadata
    Interface (JMI) which directly supports MOF and uses the
    machine readable version of the UML 1.4 specification provided
    by the OMG.</para>

    <para>Furthermore, it is our goal to provide comprehensive support 
    <indexterm><primary>XMI</primary></indexterm>
    for OCL (the Object Constraint Language) and XMI (the XML Model 
    Interchange format).</para>

    <para>ArgoUML was originally developed by a small group of people 
    as a research project. ArgoUML has many features that make it 
    special, but it does not implement all the features that commercial 
    CASE tools provide.</para>

    <para>The current version (@VERSION@) of ArgoUML implements all the 
    diagram types of the 
    
    <ulink url="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/01-09-67">UML 1.4 
    standard</ulink> (versions of ArgoUML prior to 0.20 implemented the
    <ulink url="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/00-03-01">UML 1.3 
    standard</ulink>). It is written in Java and runs on every computer 
    which provides a Java 2 platform of Java 1.4 or newer. It uses the 
    open file formats 
    <indexterm><primary>XML</primary></indexterm>
    <ulink url="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/02-01-01">
    XMI</ulink> (XML Metadata Interchange format) (for model 
    information) and <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML">
    PGML</ulink> (Precision Graphics Markup Language) (for graph 
    information) for storage. When ArgoUML implements UML 2.0, PGML
    will be replaced by the UML Diagram Interchange specification.</para>

    <para>This manual is the cumulative work of several people and has 
    been evolving over several years. Connected to the release 0.10 of 
    ArgoUML, Jeremy Bennett, wrote a lot of the new material that was 
    added to the earlier versions by Alejandro Ramirez, Philippe 
    Vanpeperstraete and Andreas Rueckert. He also added things from 
    some of the other documents namely the developers cookbook by 
    Markus Klink and Linus Tolke, the Quick Guide by Kunle Odutola, and 
    the FAQ by Dennis Daniels. Connected to the release 0.14 changes 
    were made by Linus Tolke, and by Michiel van der Wulp. These 
    changes were mostly to adopt the manual to the new functions and 
    appearance of ArgoUML version 0.14, and introduction of the index. 
    The users and developers that have contributed by providing 
    valuable input, such as review comments or observations while 
    reading and using this manual are too many to name.</para>

    <para>ArgoUML is available for free and can be used in commercial 
    settings. For terms of use, see the license agreement presented 
    when you download ArgoUML. We are providing the source code for 
    ArgoUML for you to review, customize to your needs, and improve. 
    Over time, we hope that ArgoUML will evolve into a powerful and 
    useful tool for everyone to use.</para>

    <para>This User Manual is aimed at the working designer, who wishes 
    to make use of ArgoUML. The manual is presently written assuming 
    familiarity with UML, but eventually it will support those new to 
    UML.</para>

    <para>
      The manual is written in DocBook/XML and available as both

      <title>Origins and Overview of ArgoUML</title>

      <sect2 id="s2.ooad">

        <title>Object Oriented Analysis and Design</title>

        <indexterm><primary>Analysis</primary></indexterm> 
        <indexterm><primary>Design</primary></indexterm>
        <para>Over the past decade, Object Oriented Analysis and Design 
        (OOA&amp;D) has become <emphasis>the</emphasis> dominant 
        software development paradigm. With it has come a major shift 
        in the thought processes of all involved in the software 
        development life cycle.</para>

        <para>Programming language support for objects began with 
        Simula 67, but it was the emergence in the 1980&apos;s of 
        hybrid languages, such as C++, Ada and Object Pascal that 
        allowed OOA&amp;D to take off. These languages provided support 
        for both OO and procedural programming. Object Oriented 
        <emphasis>programming</emphasis> became mainstream.</para>

        <para>An OO system is designed and implemented as a 
        <emphasis>simulation</emphasis> of the real world using 
        software artifacts. This premise is as powerful as it is 
        simple. By using an OO approach to <emphasis>design</emphasis> 
        a system can be designed and tested (or more correctly 
        simulated) without having to actually build the system 
        first.</para>

        <para>It is the development during the 1990&apos;s of tools to 
        support Object Oriented <emphasis>analysis</emphasis> and 
        <emphasis>design</emphasis> that moved this approach into the 
        mainstream. When coupled with the ability to design systems at 
        a very high level, a tool based OOA&amp;D approach has enabled 
        the implementation of more complex systems than previously 
        possible.</para>

        <para>The final driver that has propelled OOA&amp;D has been 
        its suitability for modeling graphical user interfaces. The 
        popularity of object based and object oriented graphical 
        languages such as Visual Basic and Java reflect the 
        effectiveness of this approach.</para>

        <title>The Development of ArgoUML</title>

        <para>During the 1980&apos;s a number of OOA&amp;D process 
        methodologies and notations were developed by different 
        research teams. It became clear there were many common themes 
        and, during the 1990&apos;s, a unified approach for OOA&amp;D 
        notation was developed under the auspices of the 
        <ulink url="http://www.omg.org">Object Management 
        Group</ulink>. This standard became known as the Unified 
        Modeling Language (UML), and is now the standard language for 
        communicating OO concepts.</para>

        <para>ArgoUML was conceived as a tool and environment for use 
        in the analysis and design of object-oriented software systems. 
        In this sense it is similar to many of the commercial CASE 
        tools that are sold as tools for modeling software systems. 
        ArgoUML has a number of very important distinctions from many 
        of these tools.</para>

        <para>
        	UML is the most prevalent OO modeling language and Java is
        	one of the most productive OO development platforms. Jason
        	Robbins and the rest of his research team at the University
        	of California, Irvine leveraged these benefits in creating
        	ArgoUML. The result is a solid development tool and
        	environment for OO systems design. Further, it provides a
        	test bed for the evolution of object oriented CASE tools
        	development and research.
        </para>

        <para>A first release of ArgoUML was available in 1998 and more 
        than 100,000 downloads by mid-2001 show the impact that this

          <para>Jason Elliot Robbins founded the Argo Project and 
          provided early project leadership. While Jason remains active 
          in the project, he has handed off project leadership. The 
          project continues to move forward strongly. There are more 
          than 300 members on the developer mailing list (see 
          <ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">

          <para>
          	The developer mailing list is the place where all the
          	discussion on the latest tasks takes place, and developers
          	discuss the directions the project should take. Although
          	controversial at times, these discussions are always kept
          	nice and friendly (no flame-wars and such), so newbies
          	should not hesitate and participate in them. You&apos;ll

        <para>The current release of this document is aimed at 
        experienced users of UML in OOA&amp;D (perhaps with other 
        tools) who wish to transfer to ArgoUML.</para>

      familiar with UML already. This is reflected in the sparseness of 
      the description of UML concepts in the tutorial.</para>

      <para>The case study is described, but not yet fully realized 
      throughout the tutorial. This will be achieved in future releases

      <title>Introduction (being written)</title>

      <para>
        This tutorial will be taking you through a tour of the use of
        ArgoUML to model a system.
      </para>

      <para>
        First you will become familiar with the feel of the product and then
        we will go through an analysis and development process for a test case.
        Not every nook and cranny of the product will be demonstrated.
        That amount of detail are given in the reference materials to be
        found in subsequent parts of this document.
      </para>

      <para>
        The state of the model at the end of key sections will be available in
        .zargo files.
        These are available so that you can play with various aspects not
        specifically covered in this tutorial and then
        restore yourself back to the proper state of the model in your work area.
        These .zargo files will be identified at the end of the sections whose
        work they represent.
      </para>

      <para>
        An ATM (automated teller machine) project has been chosen as a case study
        to demonstrate the various aspects of modeling that ArgoUML offers.
        In subsequent sections we are going to develop the ATM example into
        a complete description in UML.
        The tutorial, however, will only walk you through part of it.
      </para>

      <para>
        At this point you should create a directory to contain your project.
        Name the directory anything you feel is consistent with the rest of your
        file system.
        You should name the contents and any subdirectories as directed for reasons
        that will become apparent.
      </para>

      <para>
        The case study will be an ATM system.
        Your company is FlyByNight Industries.
        You are going to play two roles.
        That of the Project Manager and that of the Designer Analyst.
      </para>

      <para>
        We are not going to build a physical ATM, of course.
      </para>

      <para>
        How your company arranges its work into projects is usually determined as
        much by politics as anything else and is, therefore, out of the scope of
        this document.
        We will go into how you structure the project itself once one has been
        defined.

        <para><emphasis>Object orientation</emphasis> as a concept has 
        been around since the 1960&apos;s, and as a design concept 
        since 1972. However it was in the 1980&apos;s that it started 
        to develop as a credible alternative to a <emphasis>functional 
        approach</emphasis> in analysis and design. We can identify a 
        number of drivers.</para>

            like SmallTalk and particularly C++. C++ was a pragmatic OO

            <para>A number of very public major project failures,

            satisfactory.</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <para>A number of researchers proposed OOA&amp;D processes, and 
        with them notations. Those that achieved some success include 
        Coad-Yourdon, Booch, Rumbaugh OMT, OOSE/Jacobson, 
        Shlaer-Mellor, ROOM (for real-time design) and the hybrid 
        Jackson Structured Development.</para>

        <para>During the early 1990&apos;s it became clear that these 
        approaches had many good ideas, often very similar. A major 
        stumbling block was the diversity of notation, meaning 
        engineers tended to be familiar with one OOA&amp;D methodology, 
        rather than the approach in general.</para>

        <para>UML was conceived as a common notation, that would be in 
        the interests of all involved. The original standard was driven 
        by Rational Software (
        <ulink url="http://www.rational.com">www.rational.com</ulink>, 
        in which three of the key researchers in the field (Booch, 
        Jacobson and Rumbaugh were involved). They produced documents 
        describing UML v0.9 and v0.91 during 1996. The effort was taken 
        industry wide through the Object Management Group (OMG), 
        already well known for the CORBA standard. A first proposal, 
        1.0 was published in early 1997, with an improved version 1.1 
        approved that autumn.</para>

        <para>ArgoUML is based on UML v1.4, which was adopted by OMG in 
        March 2000. The current official version is UML v1.5 dated 
        March 2003, soon to be replaced by a major revision, UML v2.0, 
        which is in the final stages of standardization and is 
        expected to be complete in 2006.</para>

        <title>UML Based Processes for OOA&amp;D</title>

        <para>
          It is important to understand that UML is a notation for OOA&amp;D.
          It does not prescribe any particular process.
          Whatever process is adopted, it must take the system 
          being constructed through a number of phases.

            <para>Requirements Capture. This is where we identify the 
            requirements for the system, using the language of the 
            <emphasis>problem domain</emphasis>. In other words we

            <emphasis>solution domain</emphasis>. At this stage, 
            although thinking in terms of a solution, we ensure we keep 
            things at a high level, away from concrete details of a

            requirements (<emphasis>verification</emphasis>), testing 
            that the program actually solves the customer&apos;s

          <para>In recent years there has also been a move to reduce

            <title>The Waterfall Process</title>

            <para>In this process, each stage of the 
            process—requirements, analysis, design and build (code and 
            test) is completed before the next one starts. This is 
            illustrated in <xref linkend="fig.waterfallsteps"/>.</para>

            <figure float="1" id="fig.waterfallsteps">

              <title>The Waterfall Process</title>

               format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
            </figure>

            <para>This is a very satisfactory process where 
            requirements are well designed and not expected to change, 
            for example automating a well proven manual system.</para>

            <para>The weaknesses of this approach show with less well 
            defined problems. Invariably some of the uncertainties in 
            the requirements will not be clarified until well into the 
            analysis and design, or even code phases, requiring 
            backtracking to redo work.</para>

            <para>The worst aspect of this, is that working code does 
            not become available until near the end of the project, and 
            very often it is only at this stage that problems with the 
            original requirements (for example with the user interface) 
            become apparent.</para>

            <para>This is exacerbated, by each successive stage 
            requiring more effort, than the previous, so that the costs 
            of late problem discovery are hugely expensive. This is 
            illustrated by the pyramid in

            <indexterm><primary>Iterative Processes</primary></indexterm>

            <para>In recent years a new approach has been used, which 
            aims to get at least part of the code up and running as 
            quickly as possible, to bring discovery of problems forward 
            in the development cycle.</para>

            <para>These processes use a series of 
            <quote>mini-waterfalls</quote>, defining a few requirements 
            (the most important) first, taking them through analysis, 
            design and build to get an early version of the product, 
            with limited functionality, related to the most important 
            requirements. Feedback from this can then be used to refine 
            the requirements, spot problems etc before more work is 
            done.</para>

            <para>The process is then repeated for further requirements 
            to construct a product with a step up in functionality. 
            Again further feedback can be applied to the 
            requirements.</para>

            <para>
              The process is repeated, until eventually all 
              requirements have been implemented and the product is

            <para>The growth in popularity of iterative processes is 
            closely tied to the growth of OOA&amp;D. It is the clean

              <title>The Rational Unified Process</title>

              <para>Perhaps the best known Iterative Process is the 
              Rational Unified Process (RUP) from Rational Software (
              <ulink url="http://www.rational.com">www.rational.com</ulink>).</para>

              <para>This process recognizes that our pyramid view of 
              even slices of the waterfall is not realistic. In 
              practice the early iterations tend to be heavy on the 
              requirements end of things (you need to define a 
              reasonable amount even to get started), while the later 
              iterations have more of their effort in the design and 
              build areas.</para>

              <para>RUP recognizes that iterations can be grouped into 
              a number of <emphasis>phases</emphasis> according to

                <para>It should be clear that testing is an integral 
                part of all phases. Even in the early phases the

                facilitated by a good CASE tool.</para>

              <title>Iteration Size</title>

              <para>
                A good rule of thumb is that an iteration should take
                between six and ten weeks for typical commercial projects.
                Any longer and you have probably bitten off too many
                requirements to do in one go. You also lose focus on
                getting the next working iteration completed.
                Any shorter and you probably haven&apos;t got enough
                requirements to make a significant advance.
                In this case the additional overhead associated with an
                interation will become a problem.

                The total number of iterations depends on the size of project.
                Take the estimated time (working out/guessing that is a
                whole subject on its own), and divide it into 8 week chunks. 
                Experience seems to suggest that the iterations will 
                divide in the ratio of around 1:2:3:3 into RUP style 
                inception, elaboration, construction and deployment 
                phases. A project that has great vagueness in its 
                specification (some advanced research projects for 
                example) will tend to be heavier on the early 
                phases.

              <para>When building a product to contract for a customer 
              the end point is well defined. However when developing a 
              new product for the market place, a strategy that can be 
              used is to decide the product launch date, and hence the 
              end date for completion of engineering (some time 
              before). The time is then divided into iterations, and as 
              much of the product as can be built in that time 
              developed. The iterative process is very effective where 
              time to market is more important than the exact 
              functionality.</para>

            <title>Recursive Development Processes</title>

            <para>Very few software systems are conceived as monolithic 
            artifacts. They are broken down into subsystems, modules 
            etc.</para>

            <para>Software processes are the same, with early parts of 
            the process defining a top level structure, and the process 
            reapplying to parts of the structure in turn to define ever 
            greater details.</para>

            <para>For example the initial design of a telephone system 
            might identify objects to i) handle the phone lines, ii) 
            process the calls, iii) manage the system and iv) bill the 
            customer. The software process can then be reapplied to 
            each of these four components to identify their 
            design.</para>

            <para>OOA&amp;D with its clean boundaries to objects, 
            naturally supports this approach. Such OOA&amp;D with 
            recursive development is sometimes abbreviated as 
            OOA&amp;D/RD.</para>

            <para>Recursive development can be applied equally well to 
            waterfall or iterative processes. It is not an alternative 
            to them.</para>

          <title>A Development Process for This Tutorial</title>

          <para>For the purpose of this tutorial we will use a stripped 
          down iterative process with recursive development, loosely 
          akin to RUP. The case study will take us through the first 
          iteration, although at the end of the tutorial section of the 
          manual we will look at how the project will develop to 
          completion.</para>

          <para>Within that first iteration, we will tackle each of the 
          requirements capture, analysis, design and build activities 
          in turn. Not all parts of the process are based on UML or 
          ArgoUML. We will look at what other material is needed 
          outside.</para>

          <para>Within this process we will have an opportunity to see 
          the various UML diagrams in use. The full range of UML 
          diagrams and how they are supported is described in the 
          reference manual (see <xref linkend="s1.ref.diagram_types"/>

            <emphasis>Vision Document</emphasis> we will see how Use

            build a top level view of the objects that will make up the 
            solution—sometimes known as a <emphasis>concept 
            diagram</emphasis>.</para>

            <para>We will introduce the UML <emphasis>sequence 
            diagram</emphasis> and <emphasis>statechart 
            diagram</emphasis> to capture requirements for the overall 
            behavior of the system.</para>

            <para>Finally we will take the Use Cases from the 
            requirements capture stage, and recast them in the language 
            of the solution domain. This will illustrate the UML ideas 
            of <emphasis>stereotyping</emphasis> and

            to show how they can be used recursively to design the 
            complete solution.</para>

            <para>During this part of the process, we need to develop 
            our system architecture, to define how all the components 
            will fit together and operate.</para>

            <para>Although not strictly part of our process, we&apos;ll 
            look at how the UML <emphasis>collaboration 
            diagram</emphasis> can be used as an alternative to, or to 
            complement the <emphasis>sequence diagram</emphasis>. 
            Similarly we will look at the UML <emphasis>activity 
            diagram</emphasis> as an alternative or complement to the 
            statechart diagram.</para>

            <para>Finally we shall use the UML <emphasis>deployment

        <title>Why ArgoUML is Different</title>

        <para>In the introduction, we listed the four key things that 
        make ArgoUML different: i) it makes use of ideas from cognitive 
        psychology, ii) it is based on open standards; iii) it is 100% 
        pure Java; and iv) it is an open source project.</para>

                  This theory observes that designers of complex systems do not
                  conceive a design fully-formed. Instead, 
                  they must construct a partial design, evaluate, reflect 
                  on, and revise it, until they are ready to extend it further.

              Prior to UML 2.0 the XMI file includes no information about the

              is a declarative language for describing rules that apply
              to UML models.
              It was developed at IBM and is now part of the UML standard.
              Initially OCL was only a formal specification language
              extension to UML.
              OCL may now be used with any Meta-Object Facility (MOF) compliant
              metamodel, including UML.
              The Object Constraint Language is a precise text language
              that provides constraint and object query expressions on any
              MOF model or metamodel that cannot otherwise be expressed by
              diagrammatic notation.

          <title>100% Pure Java</title>

          <para>Java was conceived as an interpreted language. It 
          doesn&apos;t have a compiler to produce code for any 
          particular target machine. It compiles code for its own 
          target, the <emphasis>Java Virtual Machine 
          (JVM)</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>Writing an interpreter for a JVM is much easier than 
          writing a compiler, and such machines are now incorporated 
          into almost every Web Browser. As a result most machines can 
          run Java, with no further work.</para>

          <para>(In case you wonder why all languages aren&apos;t like 
          this, it is because interpreted languages tend to be slower 
          than compiled languages. However with the high performance of 
          modern PCs, the trade-off for portability is worthwhile for 
          many applications. Furthermore modern multi-level caches can 
          mean that interpreted languages, which produce denser code, 
          may actually not be that much slower anyway.)</para>

          <para>By choosing to write ArgoUML in pure Java, it is 
          immediately made available to the maximum number of users 
          with the minimum amount of effort.</para>

          <title>Open Source</title>

          <para>ArgoUML is an <emphasis>open source</emphasis> project. 
          That means anyone can have a free copy of the source code, 
          change it, use it for new purposes and so on. The only 
          (major) obligation is that you pass your code on in the same 
          way to others. The precise nature of what you can and 
          can&apos;t do varies from project to project, but the 
          principle is the same.</para>

          <para>
            The advantage is that a small project like ArgoUML 
            suddenly is open to a lot of additional help from those who 
            can chip in their ideas for how the program might be 
            improved.
            At any one time there may be 10, 15, 20 or more 
            people making significant contributions to ArgoUML.
            To do that commercially would cost $1m+ per year.
          </para>

          <para>Its not just a spirit of pure altruism. Contributing is 
          a way of learning <quote>hands-on</quote> about leading edge 
          software. Its a way of getting a lot of visibility (over 
          100,000 people had downloaded ArgoUML by the spring of 2001). 
          That&apos;s a lot of good experience on a resumé and a lot of 
          potential employers seeing you!</para>

          <para>And its great for the ego!</para>

          <para>Open Source doesn&apos;t preclude making money. 
          Gentleware <ulink url="http://www.gentleware.com">
          www.gentleware.com</ulink> sell a commercial version of 
          ArgoUML, Poseidon. Their value proposition is not a piece of 
          private code. Its the commercial polish and support that take 
          risk out of using ArgoUML in a commercial development, 
          allowing customers to take advantage of ArgoUML&apos;s

            <title>System Requirements</title>

            <para>Since ArgoUML is written in 100% pure Java, it should 
            run on any machine with Java installed. Java, version 1.4
            or later is needed. You may have this in place, but if not 
            it can be downloaded free from 
            <ulink url="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</ulink>. Note 
            that you only need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), 
            there is no need to download the whole Java Development Kit 
            (JDK).</para>

            <para>ArgoUML needs a reasonable amount of computing 
            resource. A PC with 200MHz processor, 64Mb RAM and 10Mb of 
            space available on a harddisk should be adequate. Download 
            the code from Download section of the project website

            It is not necessary at this point to read all of the Reference, but you
            should leaf through enough of it to become familiar with how to find
            things in it.

              As is conventional, menu options and toolbar options that are not
              available (disabled) are grayed out and menu items that invoke a
              dialog box are followed by an ellipsis (...).
              At this time you should read <xref linkend="ch.ref.toolbar"/>
              and <xref linkend="ch.ref.menu"/>.

                  The standard file menu entries present no surprises and we
                  will just use them when needed without first showing how they
                  work.
                  A number of other actions are available that are peculiar
                  to ArgoUML and we will go over them here.

                      Select the project line at the top of the Explorer.
                      It should say "untitledModel" unless you have
                      changed it.
                      Perform a
                      <emphasis>File=&gt;Export XMI</emphasis> action
                      using "DeleteThis" for an output name in the file
                      chooser dialog.
                      Select the "Properties" tab in the "Details Pane" and
                      change the name to something else, anything will do.
                      Perform a
                      <emphasis>File=&gt;Import XMI</emphasis> action.
                      It will ask you whether you want to save the changes
                      you have just made.
                      Click on "No" and then in the file choosed that
                      comes up select the "DeleteThis.xmi" file that you
                      just wrote out.
                      Observe that the name of the model has reverted back
                      to what you had saved.

                      In the Explorer Pane select one of the diagrams.
                      Either "Class Diagram 1" or "Use Case Diagram 1"
                      (assuming you haven&apos;t renamed or deleted them).
                      Perform a
                      <emphasis>File=&gt;Export Graphics</emphasis> action.
                      When the file chooser opens it defaults to the last
                      name you saved something to
                      (even from a project no longer open).
                      The file chooser allows you to select from a number
                      of formats.
                      Drop down the "Files of type" combobox and observe
                      the choices.
                      Cancel out as there is nothing useful to save.
                      Perform a
                      <emphasis>File=&gt;Export All Graphics</emphasis>
                      action.
                      Notice that this time you can&apos;t specify a file
                      name and you can&apos;t select a file format.
                      ArgoUML will allow you only to select an output
                      directory.
                      It will then create a file for each of your diagrams
                      using the diagram name for the file name and an
                      extension determined by the default graphics format.
                      Actually, although you can&apos;t select file names
                      in the browser panel, you can type one into the
                      edit box.
                      But, if you do that, nothing at all will happen.
                      You will learn more about the default graphics format
                      when we get to the <emphasis>Edit</emphasis> menu.

                      We are going to get a little ahead of ourselves here
                      and do a little class diagram work so you can see
                      what notation is all about.
                      In the Explorer Pane select or create a class diagram.
                      See <xref linkend="s1.ref.create.diagram.menu"/> and

                      Create a class in the diagram.
                      Go to the Detail Pane and create an attribute
                      in the class.
                      See <xref linkend="s2.ref.class_property_toolbar"/>.
                      In the Properties tab of the Detail Pane change the
                      multiplicity to "1..*".
                      Now go the the <emphasis>File Menu</emphasis>
                      and select <emphasis>Notation</emphasis>.
                      Go back and forth between UML and Java observing
                      the changes in the display in the Edit Pane.

                      You can change the Notation language in the
                      Properties dialog as well.
                      Click on
                      <emphasis>File=&gt;Properties</emphasis> and select
                      the Notations tab.
                      Set the Notation Language to UML1.4.
                      Turn on all of the options and click Apply.
                      Then turn off all of the options and click Apply
                      observing the changes in the diagram.
                      Set the Default Shadow Width to 8 and click Apply.
                      Notice that nothing happens.
                      This is because you are not setting the Shadow Width,
                      but its default.
                      The next time you create a class in a diagram, this
                      new shadow value will apply.

                  The edit menu does not look like what you are used to
                  in other products.
                  There are no "Cut", "Copy", or "Paste" actions.
                  All of the choices are peculiar to ArgoUML so we are

              At this time you should take the time to read
              <xref linkend="ch.ref.navpane"/>.
              The Explorer Pane is fundamental to almost everything that you do
              and we will be coming back to it again and again in what follows.
              In fact you will recall we have had to use it already.
            </para>

            <para>
              There is an expand or contract control in front of the package
              symbol for <quote>untitledModel</quote> in the Explorer Pane and
              the package symbol for <quote>Medium</quote> in the To-Do Pane.
              Click on these controls and observe that these panes are tree widgets
              that behave pretty much as you would expect them to.
              The expand or contract control is either plus (+)/minus (-) sign
              or knob with a right or bottom pointer depending upon the look and
              feel that you have chosen for an appearance.

            <para>
              Select alternately Class Diagram 1 and Use Case Diagram 1  observing
              that the detail pane changes to track to the selected item in the
              Explorer.
              The detail pane is described in Chapter 12.
              It is not necessary to read Chapter 12 at this point, but it
              couldn&apos;t hurt.

              As we go through the Editing pane changes will sometimes occur
              in the Details and the To-Do panes.
              Pay no attention to them for now.
              We will attend to them when we cover those panes.

            <para>
              Select "Class Diagram 1" in the Explorers Pane.
              The name is unimportant, if you have changed it, just select
              the new name.
              If you have deleted it, first perform a 
              Create=&gt;New Class Diagram action.
              Click on the "New Package" button in the Edit Pane tool bar.
              Click somewhere in the edit pane.
              In the Explorer notice that a package appears named
              (unnamed Package).

              Double click on the "New Class" button in Edit Pane the tool bar.
              Click first within the package and once outside of it.
              Notice that within the Explorer, two classes appear in the tree
              both named (unnamed Class) one of them attached to the model node
              and the other attached to the (unnamed Package) node.
            </para>
            <para>
              Click the Select button in the Edit Pane tool bar so you can do
              things in the Edit Pane without adding new Classes.
              In the Explorer select the class that is not subordinate to the
              package.
              This selects the corresponding class in the diagram.
              Grab this class and move it into the package.
              Notice that in the Explorer this class is now also subordinate
              to the package node.
            </para>
            <para>
              In the diagram select the other class.
              Notice that in the Explorer, the selected node
              changes correspondingly.
              Grab this class and move it outside of the package and watch
              what happens in the Explorer.

            <para>The mouse and mouse buttons (or their equivalent with 
            alternative tracking devices) are used in a wide variety of 
            ways. In this section we look at the common modes of 
            use.</para>

            <para>ArgoUML assumes a two button mouse. We will refer to 
            the buttons as <quote>button 1</quote> and <quote>button 
            2</quote>. Button 1 is the leftmost button on a 
            right-handed mouse, and sometimes referred to as the 
            <quote>select</quote> button. Button 2 is sometimes 
            referred to as the <quote>adjust</quote> button.</para>

            <orderedlist>

              <listitem>

                <para><emphasis>Button 1 click</emphasis>. This action 
                is generally used to select an item for subsequent 
                operations. If the item is an artifact in the explorer 
                or the editing pane it will be highlighted.</para>

                <para>In the case of the Edit Pane Toolbar, that 
                artifact is selected as the next to be added to the 
                diagram (but only once—see double clicking for adding 
                multiple artifacts). The adding to the diagram is 
                achieved by moving the mouse to the editing area and

                edit pane toolbar. Under these circumstances the 
                selected artifact will be added multiple times to the 
                drawing area, once for each further button click, until

                <para>Button 1 motion also has an effect in the editing

                are selected show handles, and these can be used for 
                re-sizing.</para>

                <para>Where the artifact is some form of connector 
                between other items, button 1 motion other than at a

                the connector to be articulated at that point. Such new

            <para>As well as UML artifacts, the Edit pane toolbar 
            provides for general drawing artifacts (rectangles,

              <para>Please notice that the File menu contains the usual

              existing project, for saving a project under a new name, 
              for printing the currently displayed diagram, for saving

              program Exit.</para>

              <para>Some of these menu commands can be invoked by 
              pressing key combinations, as indicated on the drop-down

              key, and pressing <quote>N</quote>, will create a new

              <para>In the current version, ArgoUML can only contain 
              one active project at a time. In addition, a project can 
              only contain one UML model. Since an UML model can 
              contain an unlimited number of elements and diagrams, 
              this should not present any serious limitations, even for 
              modeling quite large and complex systems.</para>

              <para>This is a standard Java FileChooser. Let&apos;s go 
              over it in some detail.</para>

              <para>The main, outstanding feature, is the scrollable 
              folders list in the center of the dialog. By using the 
              scroll bar on the right, you can move up and down in the 
              list of folders contained inside the currently selected 
              folder. If it is scrollable or not depends on the amount 
              of files and folders shown and also how they are shown. 
              If everything fits the window is not scrollable as seen 
              in the picture.</para>

              <para>Double-clicking on one of the displayed folders 
              navigates you into that folder, allowing you to quickly 
              navigate down into the folders hierarchy on your hard 
              disk.</para>

              <para>Notice that only folder names, and no file names 
              are displayed in the scrollable area. Indeed, the dialog 
              is currently set up in order to show only ArgoUML project 
              files with an extension of <literal>.zargo</literal>, as 
              can be seen on the lower drop-down control labeled 
              <literal>Files of Type:</literal>.</para>

              <para>Also notice that the currently selected 
              folder&apos;s name is displayed in the upper drop-down 
              control labeled <literal>Look in:</literal>. A single 
              click on a folder inside the scrollable area does select 
              that folder on screen but does not select the folder for 
              saving.</para>

              <para>At the top of the dialog, above the scrollable 
              folder chooser area, there are a few more folder 
              navigation tools.</para>

                Most modern UML

            <para>The project contains a top-level package, called 
            <literal>untitledModel</literal>, which contains a class 
            diagram and a use case diagram.</para>

            <para>If we look carefully at the screen, we can see that 
            the &quot;Medium&quot; folder in the To-Do Pane (the lower 
            left pane) must contain some items, since its activation 
            icon <guiicon>
            <inlinegraphic fileref="images/tutorial/guitreefoldercloseicon.gif"
             format="GIF"/></guiicon> is displayed.</para>

            <para>Clicking on this icon will open the 
            &quot;Medium&quot; folder. An open folder is indicated by 
            the <guiicon>
            <inlinegraphic fileref="images/tutorial/guitreefolderopenicon.gif"
             format="GIF"/></guiicon> icon.</para>

            <para>But what is this <quote>To-Do</quote> Pane anyway. 
            You haven&apos;t recorded anything yet that has to be done, 
            so where do these to do items originate.</para>

            <para>The answer is simple, and is at the same time one of 
            the strong points of ArgoUML. While you are working on your 
            UML model, your work is monitored continuously and 
            invisibly by a piece of code called a <emphasis>design 
            critic</emphasis>. This is like a personal mentor that 
            watches over your shoulder and notifies you each time he 
            sees something questionable in your design.</para>

            <para>Critics are quite unobtrusive. They give you a 
            friendly warning, but they do not force you into design 
            principles that you don&apos;t want or like to follow. Let 
            us take a look at what the critics are telling us. Click on 
            the <guiicon>
            <inlinegraphic fileref="images/tutorial/guitreefoldercloseicon.gif"
             format="GIF"/></guiicon> icon next to the <literal>

            <para>Notice that your selection is highlighted in red in

            the Details Pane (the lower right pane). You may have to 
            re-size your Details Pane or to scroll down in order to see 
            the full message as displayed in our example.</para>

            <para>What ArgoUML is trying to tell you is that usually, 
            package names are written in lower cases. The default top 
            level package created by ArgoUML is called <literal>
            untitledModel</literal> and therefore violates a sound 
            design principle. (Actually, this could be considered as a 
            bug within ArgoUML, but it comes in handy to demonstrate 
            the working of critics).</para>

            <para>At this point, you can choose to change the package 
            name manually, to impose silence on the design critic for 
            some time or permanently, or to request a more 
            comprehensive explanation by Email from an expert.</para>

            <para>We will do nothing of this (we&apos;ll come back to 
            it when we talk about the design critics in more detail) 
            but we&apos;ll use another handy feature of ArgoUML—an 
            auto-correct feature.</para>

            <para>In order to do that, just click on the <literal>
            Next</literal> button on the Details Pane. This will cause 
            a renaming wizard to be displayed inside the properties 
            panel, proposing to use the name <literal>
            untitledmodel</literal> (all in lower case).</para>

            <para>If this doesn&apos;t happen at once, wait for a few

          Here is where we are going to start the Case Study.
          It is at this point that you define your project;
          not your product, but your project.
          It can be argued that modeling concepts should apply here as well
          but this has not been well established.
          If you can take the time to look into the ArgoUML project, you will
          find that there are a large number of "lines of code" and lines of
          documentation that are part of the project, but not part of the
          product.
          For example, this document is part of the product while the Cookbook
          and the build.xml files are part of the project only.
          At a minimum the file structure of the project could be shown in a
          package diagram.

      <title>Requirements Capture</title>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <indexterm>
        <primary>Requirement</primary><secondary>Capturing</secondary></indexterm>
        <para>Requirements capture is the process of identifying what 
        the <quote>customer</quote> wants from the proposed 
        system.</para>

        <para>The key at this stage is that we are in the problem 
        domain. At this stage we must describe everything from the 
        <quote>customer</quote> perspective and in the language of the 
        <quote>customer</quote>.</para>

        <para>The biggest risk we have in requirements capture is to 
        start thinking in terms of possible solutions. That must wait 
        until the <emphasis>Analysis Phase</emphasis> (see 
        <xref linkend="ch.tut.analysis"/>). One of the steps of the 
        Analysis Phase will be to take the output of the Requirements 
        Phase and recast it in the language of a deemed solution.</para>

        <para>Remember we are using both a 
        <emphasis>incremental</emphasis>, and an 
        <emphasis>iterative</emphasis> process.</para>

        <para>We may well come back to the requirements process again 
        as we break down the problem into smaller chunks, each of which 
        must have its requirements captured.</para>

        <para>We will certainly come back through the requirements 
        phase on each iteration as we seek to define the requirements 
        of more and more of the system</para>

        <note>

          <para>The only part of the requirements notation specified by 
          the UML standard is the use case diagram. The remainder is 
          process specific. The process described in this chapter draws 
          heavily on the Rational Unified Process.</para>

        <title>The Requirements Capture Process</title>

        <indexterm><primary>Vision Document</primary></indexterm>
        <para>We start with a top-level view of the problem we are 
        solving and the key areas of functionality that we must address 
        in any solution. This is our <emphasis>vision 
        document</emphasis>, and should be just a few pages long.</para>

        <para>For example the top-level view of an automated teller 
        machine (ATM) might be that it should support the 
        following.</para>

        <orderedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>Cash deposit, cash withdrawal and account inquiries 
            by customers.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Maintenance of the equipment by the bank&apos;s 
            engineers, and unloading of deposits and loading of cash by 
            the local bank branch.</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>Audit trail for all activities sent to the 
            bank&apos;s central computer.</para>

          </listitem>

        </orderedlist>

        <indexterm><primary>Actor</primary></indexterm>
        <para>From this top-level view we can extract the principal 
        activities of the system, and the external agents (people, 
        equipment) that are involved in those activities. These 
        activities are known as <emphasis>use cases</emphasis> and the 
        external agents are known as <emphasis>actors</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Actors may be people or machines. From a practical 
        standpoint it is worth knowing the stakeholder behind any 
        machine, since only they will be able to engage with the 
        requirements capture process.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>Use Case</primary></indexterm>
        <para>Use cases should be significant activities for the 
        system. For example customer use of the ATM machine is a use 
        case. Entering a PIN number is not.</para>

        <para>There is a gray area between these two extremes. As we 
        shall see it is often useful to break very large use cases into 
        smaller sub-use cases. For example we may have sub-use cases 
        covering cash deposit, cash withdrawal and account 
        inquiry.</para>

        <para>There is no hard and fast rule. Some architects will 
        prefer a small number of relatively large use cases, others 
        will prefer a larger number of smaller use cases. A useful rule 
        of thumb is that any practical project ought to require no more 
        than about 30 use cases (if it needs more, it should be broken 
        into separate projects).</para>

        <para>We then show the relationship between use cases and 
        actors on one or more use case diagrams. For a large project 
        more than one diagram will be needed. Usually groups of related 
        use cases are shown on one diagram.</para>

        <para>We must then give a more detailed specification of each 
        use case. This covers its normal behavior, alternative 
        behaviors and any pre- and post-conditions. This is captured in 
        a document variously known as a <emphasis>use case 
        specification</emphasis> or <emphasis>use case 
        scenario</emphasis>.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>Supplementary Requirement 
        Specification</primary></indexterm>
        <para>Finally, since use cases are functional in nature, we 
        need a document to capture the non-functional requirements 
        (capacity, performance, environmental needs etc). These 
        requirements are captured in a document known as a 
        <emphasis>supplementary requirements 
        specification</emphasis>.</para>

          machine</quote>, <quote>maintain machine</quote> and 
          <quote>audit</quote> as the three main use cases. We have 
          identified <quote>customer</quote>, maintenance 
          engineer<quote>,</quote><quote>local branch official</quote> 
          and <quote>central computer</quote> as the actors.</para>

          <para><xref linkend="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_basic"/> 
          shows how this could be displayed on a use case diagram. The 
          use cases are shown as ovals, the actors as stick people 
          (even where they are machines), with lines (known as 
          <emphasis>associations</emphasis> connecting use cases to the 
          actors who are involved with them. A box around the use cases 
          emphasizes the boundary between the system (defined by the 
          use cases) and the actors who are external.</para>

          <note>

            <para>Not all analysts like to use a box around the use 
            cases. It is a matter of personal choice.</para>

          <para>The following sections show how the basic use case 
          diagram can be extended to show additional information about 
          the system being designed.</para>

          <sect3>

            <title>Active and Passive Actors</title>

            <indexterm><primary>Active Actor</primary></indexterm>
            <para><emphasis>Active</emphasis> actors initiate 
            interaction with the system. This can be shown by placing 
            an arrow on the association from the actor pointing toward 
            the use case. In the ATM example, the customer is an active 
            actor.</para>

            <indexterm><primary>Passive Actor</primary></indexterm>
            <para>Interaction with <emphasis>passive</emphasis> actors 
            is initiated by the system. This can be shown by placing an 
            arrow on the association from the use case pointing toward 
            the actor. In the ATM example, the central computer is a 
            passive actor.</para>

            <para>This is a good example where the arrow helps, since 
            it allows us to distinguish an event driven system (the ATM 
            initiates interaction with the central computer) from a 
            polling system (the central computer interrogates the ATM 
            from time to time).</para>

            <para>Where an actor may be either active or passive, 
            depending on circumstances, the arrow may be omitted. In 
            the ATM example the bank engineer fits into this category. 
            Normally he is active, turning up on a regular cycle to 
            service the machine. However if the ATM detects a fault, it 
            may summon the engineer to fix it.</para>

            <para>
              The use of arrows on associations is referred to as 
              the <emphasis>navigation</emphasis> of the association.
              We shall see this used elsewhere in UML later on.
              The choice, by the OMG, of zero vice two arrowheads to show
              a bidirectional association is unfortunate.
              Under this convention you cannot distinguish between an
              association whose navigation has yet to be determined and one
              that is bidirectional.

            Use Case Diagram</secondary></indexterm>
            <para>It can be useful to show the 
            <emphasis>multiplicity</emphasis> of associations between 
            actors and use cases. By this we mean how many instances of 
            an actor interact with how many instances of the use 
            case.</para>

            <para>By default we assume one instance of an actor 
            interacts with one instance of a use case. In other cases 
            we can label the multiplicity of one end of the 
            association, either with a number to indicate how many 
            instances are involved, or with a range separated by two 
            periods (<literal>..</literal>). An asterisk (
            <literal>*</literal>) is used to indicate an arbitrary 
            number.</para>

            <para>In the ATM example, there is only one central 
            computer, but it may be auditing any number of ATM uses. So 
            we place the label <literal>0..*</literal> at the use case 
            end. There is no need for a label at the other end, since 
            the default is one.</para>

            <para>A local bank will have up to three officials 
            authorized to unload and load ATM machines. So at the actor 
            end of the relationship with the use case <literal>Maintain 
            ATM</literal>, we place the label <literal>1..3</literal>. 
            They may be dealing with any number of ATM machines, so at 
            the other end we place the label <literal>
            0..*</literal>.</para>

            <para>There may be any number of customers and there may be 
            any number of ATM systems they could use. So at each end of 
            the association we place the label <literal>
            0..*</literal>.</para>

            <para>In our ATM example so far we have just three use 
            cases to describe all the behavior of the system. While use 
            cases should always describe a significant chunk of system 
            behavior, if they are too general they can be difficult to 
            describe.</para>

            <para>We could for example define the behavior of the use 
            case <quote>Use ATM</quote> in terms of the behavior of 
            three simpler use cases, <quote>Deposit Cash</quote>, 
            <quote>Withdraw Cash</quote> and <quote>Query 
            Account</quote>. The main use case could be specified by 
            <emphasis>including</emphasis> the behavior of the 
            subsidiary use cases where needed.</para>

            <para>Similarly the <quote>Maintain ATM</quote> use case 
            could be defined in terms of two use cases <quote>Maintain 
            Equipment</quote> and <quote>Reload ATM</quote>. In this 
            case the two actors involved in the main use case are 
            really only involved in one or other of the two subsidiary 
            use cases and this can be shown on the diagram.</para>

            <para>The decomposition of a use case into simpler sub-use

            relationship</emphasis>, a dotted arrow from the main use 
            case to the subsidiary, with the label

            <para>Include relationships are fine for breaking down the 
            use case behaviors in to hierarchies. However we may also 
            want to show a use case that is an 
            <emphasis>extension</emphasis> to an existing use case to 
            cater for a particular circumstance.</para>

            <para>In the ATM example we have a use case covering 
            routine maintenance of the ATM, <quote>Maintain 
            Equipment</quote>. We also want to cover the special case 
            of an unscheduled repair caused by the ATM detecting an 
            internal fault.</para>

            <para>This is shown in UML by the 
            <emphasis>extend</emphasis> relationship. In the main use 
            case, we specify a name for a location in the description, 
            where an extension to the behavior could be attached. The 
            name and location are shown in a separate compartment 
            within the use case oval. The representation extend 
            relationship is the same as the include relationship, but 
            with the label <emphasis>«extend»</emphasis>. Alongside the 
            extend relationship, we specify the condition under which 
            that behavior will be attached.</para>

            getting rather complex, and so we have split it into two, 
            one for the maintenance side of things, the other for 
            customer usage and audit.</para>

            <para>The <quote>Maintain Equipment</quote> use case 
            defines a name <quote>Unsched</quote>, at the start of its 
            description. The extending use case <quote>Unscheduled 
            Repair</quote> is attached there when the ATM detects an 
            internal error.</para>

            <para>
              Use cases may be linked together in one other way. 
              One use case may be a <emphasis>generalization</emphasis>
              of a subsidiary use case (or alternatively the subsidiary 
              is a <emphasis>specialization</emphasis> of the main use 
              case).
              This is very like the extends relationship, but 
              without the constraint of specific extension points at 
              which the main use case may be extended, and with no 
              condition on when the subsidiary use case may be 
              used.</para>

            <para>
              Generalization is shown on a use case diagram by an 
              arrow with solid line and solid white head from the 
              subsidiary to the main use case.
              This may be useful when a subsidiary use case 
              specializes the behavior of the main use case at a large 
              number of positions and under a wide range of 
              circumstances.
              However the lack of any restriction makes 
              generalization very hard to specify precisely.
              In general use an extend relationship instead.

              one of a series of subsidiary use cases that are included 
              in a main use case, where they can form the 
              pre-conditions of the next use case to be included.</para>

              <caution>

                <para>Like pre-conditions, post-conditions are best 
                avoided. They place a burden on the specification of 
                the use case flows, to ensure that the post-condition 
                always holds. They therefore are also a source of 
                problems and extra work.</para>

              <para><emphasis>Requirements</emphasis>. In an ideal 
              world the vision document, use case diagrams, use case 
              specifications and supplementary requirements 
              specification would form the requirements for a 
              project.</para>

              <para>For most market-led developments, where ownership 
              of requirements is within the same business as the team 
              who will do the development, this is now usually the 
              case. The marketing department can learn use case based 
              requirements capture and analysis to link to their 
              customer facing activities.</para>

              <para>However for external contract developments, 
              customers may insist on a traditional <quote>list of 
              features</quote> as the basis of the contract. Where this 
              is the case, this section of the use case specification 
              should link to the contract features that are covered by 
              the use case.</para>

              <para>This is often done through a third party tool that 
              can link documents, providing automated checking of 
              coverage, in which case this section is not needed, or 
              may be generated automatically.</para>

          <para>The final size of the use case specification will 
          depend on the complexity of the use case. As a rule of thumb, 
          most use cases take around 10-15 pages to specify, the bulk 
          of which is alternate flows. If you are much larger than 
          this, consider breaking the use case down. If you are much 
          smaller consider whether the use case is addressing too small 
          a chunk of behavior.</para>

            <para>All flows in a use case specification are linear—that 
            is there is no conditional branching. Any choices in flows 
            are handled by specifying another alternate flow that takes 
            over at the choice point. It is important to remember we 
            are specifying behavior here, not programming it.</para>

            <para>A flow is specified as a series of numbered steps. 
            Each step must involve some interaction with an actor, or 
            at least generate a change that is observable externally by 
            an actor. Requirements capture should not be specifying 
            hidden internal behavior of a system.</para>

            <para>For example we might give the following sequence of 
            steps for the basic flow of the use case &quot;Withdraw 
            Cash&quot; in our ATM example.</para>

              receipt will be an alternative flow.</para>

          <para>This captures the non-functional requirements or

            <para>Some analysts like to place non-functional

            <para>
              This can cause some problems.
              First key non-functional requirements (for example about
              performance) may need to appear in many use cases and it is bad
              practice to replicate information.
              Secondly there are invariably some non-functional requirements
              that are system wide and need a system wide document.
              Hence my preference for a single supplementary requirements
              specification.

        upper left quadrant of the user screen).</para>

        <para>New use case diagrams can be created as needed through 
        <literal>Create Diagram</literal> on the main menu bar or on

          <para>To add an actor to the diagram use button 1 click on

          and then button 1 click at the location where you wish to 
          place it. The actor can be moved subsequently by button 1 
          motion (i.e. button 1 down over the actor to select it, move 
          to the new position and button 1 release to drop the actor in 
          place.</para>

          <para>Multiple actors can be added in one go, by using 
          button 1 double click on the actor icon. Each subsequent 
          button 1 click will drop an actor on the diagram. A button 1 
          click on the select icon (

          will stop adding actors.</para>

          <para>The actors name is set in its property panel. First 
          select the actor (if not already selected) on the editing 
          pane using button 1 click. Then click on the <literal>
          Properties</literal> tab in the details pane. The name is 
          entered in the name field, and will appear on the

          actor in the editing pane (or just typing on the keyboard

          directly. This is a convenient way to enter a name for a new 
          actor.</para>

          <para>Having created the actor, you will see it appear in the 
          explorer (the upper left quadrant of the user screen). This 
          shows all the artifacts created within the UML design. A drop 
          down at the top of the explorer controls the ordering of

          finish at the use case).</para>

          <para>This will create a straight line between actor and use 
          case. You can segment the line by holding down button 1 down 
          on the line and moving before releasing. A vertex will be 
          added to the line, which you can move by button 1 motion. A 
          vertex can be removed by picking it up and sliding to one end 
          of the line.</para>

          <para>Multiple associations can be added in one go, by using 
          button 1 double click on the association icon. Each 
          subsequent button 1 down/motion/release sequence will join an

          <para>It is also possible to add associations using small

          use case or actor when it is selected and the mouse is over 
          it. Dragging the handle from a use case to an actor will 
          create an association to that actor (and similarly by 
          dragging a handle from an actor to a use case).</para>

          <para>Dragging a handle from a use case into empty space will 
          create a new actor to go on the other end. Similarly dragging 
          a handle from an actor into empty space will create a new use 
          case.</para>

          <para>It is possible to give an association a name, 
          describing the relationship of the actor to the use case, 
          although this is not usually necessary. This is done through

          alongside the association near its center.</para>

            UML as originally designed allowed use cases to be organized by

            them.
            In ArgoUML only the relations mechanism is supported.
            All Three of the relations that apply to use cases are supported.
            These are <emphasis>include</emphasis>, <emphasis>extend</emphasis>

            <para>The procedure for adding generalizations, is the same

            <para>Since generalization is a directed relationship, the

            handle at the top to another use case will create a 
            generalization. The original use case is the specializing 
            end, and the use case to which the handle was dragged will 
            be the generalizing end. Dragging into empty space will 
            create a new use case to be the generalizing end.</para>

            <para>Similarly dragging on the bottom handle will create a

            <para>Generalization is also permitted between actors,

          <para>
            UML has the concept of <emphasis>stereotyping</emphasis> as a way
            of extending the basic notation.
            It may prove useful for example to model a problem at both the
            business level and the engineering level. 
            It is for this reason that the OMG distinguishes between a PIM
            and a PSM.
            For both of these we will need use cases, but the use cases 
            at the business level hold a different sort of information to 
            those at the engineering level.
            Very likely they use different language and notation in their
            underlying use case specifications.
          </para>

          <para><emphasis>Stereotypes</emphasis> are used to label UML 
          artifacts such as use cases, to indicate that they belong to 
          a certain category. Such labels are shown in guillemots (
          <literal>«»</literal>) above the name of the artifact on the 
          diagram. The UML standard defines a number of standard 
          stereotypes, and the user may define more stereotypes of his 
          own.</para>

          <para>You will see that ArgoUML has a drop down selector, 
          <literal>Stereotype</literal> on every property tab. This is 
          populated with the standard stereotypes, to which you may add 
          your own user defined ones.</para>

          <para>The details of stereotyping are beyond the scope of 
          this tutorial. The reference manual (see 
          <xref linkend="s1.ref.stereotype"/>) documents the support 
          provided in ArgoUML.</para>

          <warning>

            <para>ArgoUML is missing a few of the standard UML 
            stereotypes. In addition not all artifacts will actually 
            display the stereotype on the diagram. At present this 
            includes use cases and actors.</para>

          <title>Documentation</title>

          <indexterm><primary>Documentation in Use Case 
          Diagrams</primary></indexterm>
          <para>ArgoUML has some simple documentation facilities 
          associated with artifacts on a diagram. In general these 
          should be used only to record the location of material in 
          documents that can be handled by a mainstream editor or word 
          processor, not the actual documentation itself.</para>

          <para>Documentation for a particular artifact is recorded 
          through the documentation tab in the details pane (the 
          quadrant of the user screen at the bottom right).</para>

          <para>In addition annotation may be added to diagrams using 
          the text icon on the editing pane toolbar (
          <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/icons/text.gif"
           format="GIF"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>).</para>

          <para>The recommendation is that a use case diagram should 
          use the documentation tab of actors to record information 
          about the actor, or if the actor is complex to refer to a 
          separate document that holds information about the 
          actor.</para>

          <para>The documentation tab of use cases should record the 
          location of the use case specification. The information in a 
          use case specification (for all but the simplest use cases) 
          is too complex to be placed directly in the tab.</para>

          <para>The project should also have a separate vision document 
          and supplementary requirements specification. A text 
          annotation on diagrams may be used to refer to these if the 
          user finds this helpful.</para>

          <warning>

            <para>The documentation tab includes a <literal>
            Deprecated</literal> check box. The state of this flag is 
            not preserved over save and load in the current release of 
            ArgoUML</para>

          <title>System Boundary Box</title>

          <indexterm><primary>System Boundary Box in Use Case 
          Diagram</primary></indexterm>
          <para>ArgoUML provides a series of tools to provide arbitrary 
          graphical annotation on diagrams (we have already mentioned 
          the text tool). These are found at the right hand end of the 
          editing pane toolbar and are fully documented in the 
          reference manual (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.editpane"/>
          ).</para>

          <para>The rectangle tool can be used to draw the boundary 
          box. Use the button 2 context-sensitive <literal>
          Ordering</literal> pop-up menu to place it behind everything 
          else. However there is no way to change its fill color from 
          the default white. You may therefore prefer to draw the 
          boundary box as four lines. This is the method used for the 
          diagrams in this chapter.</para>

          <note>

            <para>The editing pane in ArgoUML has a grid to which 
            objects snap to aid in drawing. The size of this grid and 
            its effect may be altered through the <literal>
            View</literal> menu (using <literal>Adjust Grid</literal> 
            and <literal>Adjust Grid Snap</literal>). This is described 
            fully in the reference manual (see

            <para>To produce better designed products based on newer 
            technology. Follow the MDA philosophy of the OMG by 
            producing first a Platform Independent Model (PIM). As 
            current modeling technology does not admit of maintaining 
            the integrity of the connection between the PIM and 
            Platform Specific Models (PSMs), the PIM will become 
            comparatively stable before the first iteration of the PSM 
            is produced. The software platform will be Java technology. 
            The system will use a simple userid (from ATM card) and 
            password (or PIN) mechanism.</para>

          <xref linkend="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_include"/> and 
          <xref linkend="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_extend"/>, and 
          progress to identify additional actors and use cases that 
          comprise our model of the ATM system. 
          <xref linkend="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_include"/> and 
          <xref linkend="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_extend"/> 
          exemplified the essential concepts and components of a use 
          case diagram such as, use cases, actors, multiplicity, and 
          include / extend relationships. They showed the relationships 
          between the actors and use cases, and demonstrated how these 
          actors and use cases interact.</para>

          <para>In 
          <xref linkend="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_include"/> we see 
          a use case diagram for an ATM system consisting of «include» 
          relationships for the use cases, Maintain ATM and Use ATM. 
          Maintain ATM was further defined by two use cases, 
          &quot;Maintain Equipment&quot; and &quot;Reload ATM&quot;. 
          Use ATM was further defined in terms of the behavior of three 
          simpler use cases: &quot;Deposit Cash&quot;, &quot;Withdraw 
          Cash&quot; and &quot;Query Account&quot;.</para>

      <title>Analysis</title>


        <para>Analysis is the process of taking the 
        <quote>customer</quote> requirements and re-casting them in the 
        language of, and from the perspective of, a putative 
        solution.</para>

        <para>We are not actually trying the flesh out the detailed 
        solution at this stage. That occurs in the <emphasis>Design 
        Phase</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="ch.tut.design"/>).</para>

        <para>Unlike the boundary between Requirements and Analysis 
        Phases, the boundary between Analysis and Design Phases is 
        inherently blurred. The key is that analysis should define the 
        solution no further than is necessary to specify the 
        requirements in the language of the solution. The artifacts in 
        Analysis generally represent a high level of abstraction.</para>

        <para>Once again the <emphasis>recursive</emphasis>, and 
        <emphasis>iterative</emphasis> nature of our process means we 
        will come back to the Analysis phase many times in the 
        future.</para>

      <sect1>

        <title>The Analysis Process</title>

        <para>
          There are three schools of thought on how Analysis
          should be approached.
          The ontologist defines the data (actually the metadata)
          first and worries about processes later.
          The true ontologist would prefer not to have to think
          about processes at all.
          The phenomenonologist reverses this and favors
          process over data.
          The panparadigmist considers both process and data to be
          equally important and addresses both from the start.
        </para>

        <para>
          When it comes to being a purist the ontologist has
          the upper hand.
          It is possible to define and build a database into
          which data can be entered and retrieved without concern for
          what happens to it or is done with it.
          On the other hand implementing a process without having any
          data structures for it to operate on is not very meaningful.
        </para>

        <sect2>

          <title>Class, Responsibilities, and Collaborators (CRC) Cards</title>

          <para>
            The CRC methodology favors the phenomenonologists
            preference for analysis.
            It is the equivalent of starting with the use cases,
            the process aspects (operations) of the class diagrams,
            and scenarios from which sequence diagrams can be initiated.
          </para>

          <para>
            CRC cards and the associated methodology are described
            in detail in <xref linkend="app.crc"/>.
            They are used again in the design phase and are further
            discussed in <xref linkend="ch.tut.design"/>.
          </para>

          <para>
            The strength of CRC cards during analysis.

          </itemizedlist>
          </para>

          <para>
            In this phase the group should consist of two or
            three domain experts, one object-oriented technology
            facilitator, and the rest of the group made up of people
            who are responsible for delivering the system.
          </para>

          <para>
            The first time that the Analysis phase occurs a special
            case of the CRC session happens as there are no classes
            or scenarios to choose from to define a CRC session.
            At this point a special type of session known
            as brainstorming is held.
            During this session you identify the initial set of
            classes in the problem domain by using the problem statement
            or requirements document or whatever you know about the
            desired result for a starting point.
            The nouns that are found in whatever you are starting from are
            a good key to an initial set of classes in the system.
            In a brainstorming session there should be little or no
            discussion of the ideas.
            Record them and filter the results after the brainstorming.
            At this stage the distinction between class and object
            is blurred.
          </para>

          <para>
            Once a reasonable set of classes has been defined
            by the group, responsibilities can be added.
            Add responsibilities that are obvious from the requirements
            or the name of the class.
            You don&apos;t need to find them all (or any for that matter).
            The scenarios will make them more obvious.
            The advantage of finding some in the beginning is that
            it helps provide a starting place.

            Select the initial scenarios from the requirements document
            by examining it&apos;s verbs in much the same way that we scanned
            its nouns earlier.
            Then as many walk through sessions as necessary to complete
            the analysis phase are performed.

          <para>
            When is enough of the analysis complete that design can begin?
            When all the different responsibilities are in place
            and the system has become stable.
            After all the normal behavior has been covered, exceptional
            behavior needs to be simulated.
            When you notice that the responsibilities are all in place to
            support the new scenarios, and there is little change to the
            cards, this is a sign the you are ready to start design.

          and extract the nouns from it.
          This list should be compacted to contain only those nouns that are
          expected to result in a class.
          This effort results in the following.

            The project manager convenes a CRC session at which the initial

            The facilitator reminds the participants that we are in the
            analysis phase and are only interested in what needs to be done
            (at the business level) and are to leave out anything that smacks
            of how to do it.
            As a general rule of thumb this means a subset of
            the nouns from the problem statement (see above).
            The group starts with a complete list of all of the nouns in the
            statement, examines each one, and decides which are inappropriate
            crossing them off the list.
            Each class is then assigned to one of the participants.

        The big step is casting everything into

          The design process extends the modeling effort beyond the business
          concerns and into the solutions space.
          It is during this effort that you decide whether you are going to use
          Java, C++, J2EE, CORBA, SOAP, Dial up line, internet connection
          dedicated line, XML, etc.
          Many of these decisions will impact directly the PSM model, others
          may only be reflected in the documents produced.

          </para>

          <para>
            The focus of the group moves from what is to be done to
            how to do it.
            The classes from the solution domain are added to
            those defined in the analysis phase.
            Think about what classes are needed to make the system work.
            Do you need a List class to hold objects?
            Do you need classes to handle exceptions?
            Do you need wrapper classes for other subsystems?
            New classes that are looked for in this part, are classes
            that support the implementation of the system.
          </para>

          <para>
            During the design phase the distinction between class and object
            becomes important.
            Think about the objects in your scenarios.
            Who creates the objects?
            What happens when it is created and destroyed?
            What is the lifetime of the object vs. the lifetime of the
            information held be the object?
          </para>

          <para>
            Now is the time to look at what information the objects hold
            compared to what is requested from other classes or computed
            on the fly.
            Use the back of the card to record the attributes found for
            the classes.
            Break you responsibilities into subresponsibilities and list the
            subresponsibilities indented under the main responsibilities.
            Move the collaborators next to the subresponsibilities
            that use them.
          </para>

          <para>
            After the Collaborator class on your card list the responsibility
            of the used class that is used in the collaboration.
            After the collaborating responsibilities on your cards, list the
            data passed back by the collaborating object in parenthesis.
          </para>

          <para>
            Redo the scenarios you did in the analysis phase, but know take
            into consideration all of the design heuristics discussed.
            Make up your own scenarios and try them.

      <title>Code Generation, Reverse Engineering, and Round Trip 
      Engineering</title>

      <sect1>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>We now have our design fully specified. With the right 
        simulator we could actually execute the design and see if it 
        works. (ArgoUML does not provide such functionality, but this 
        functionality has been provided in alternative tools.)</para>

        <para>ArgoUML does allow you to generate code from the design 
        in several different programming languages. We, most likely, 
        already in the design had a programming language in mind 
        because some of the design considerations are to care for a 
        specific language.</para>

        <para>The output of this process is the set of files that 
        constitute the program that solves the problem.</para>

        <para>Once again the <emphasis>recursive</emphasis>, and 
        <emphasis>iterative</emphasis> nature of our process means we 
        will come back to the Build phase many times in the 
        future.</para>

        <para>There is also another side to this and that is the 
        reverse engineering side. If we happen to have an old program 
        that we would like to examine then we could take the files and 
        reverse engineer them to create a design. This can be used when 
        trying to understand some not so well documented program or as 
        a quick start for the design work.</para>

        <para>The process of going back and forth between doing changes 
        in the design followed by a code generation and then doing 
        changes in the code followed by a reverse engineering using for 
        every change, the best possible perspective, is called 
        Round-trip Engineering.</para>

        <para>The output of the Code Generation is the completed 
        program. Depending on the contents of the design, we could also 
        generate Unit test cases.</para>

        <para>To do the work we need the design model, containing both 
        static and dynamic descriptions of the program.</para>

          <para>

            It is rather straightforward to do this generation, at 
            least as long as we do it for an object-oriented language. 
            This is some of the basic rules:
            <itemizedlist>

              <listitem>

                <para>A class will become a class.</para>

                <para>In some target languages (like java, c++) they 
                also become files and compilation units.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>A generalization will become an 
                inheritance.</para>

                <para>If the target language does not support 
                inheritance and we didn&apos;t address this during the 
                design, some special conversions are required to solve 
                this.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>An attribute will become a member variable.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>A navigable association will become a member 
                variable.</para>

                <para>Depending on the target language, target 
                platform, and the association multiplicities this will 
                be a pointer, a reference, a collection class, an entry 
                in some table or map.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>A non-abstract operation in a class will become a 
                method.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>An abstract operation in a class will become an 
                abstract method.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>An in parameter in an operation will become a 
                parameter in the method.</para>

                <para>For simple types (int, boolean), this is the 
                normal case. For C++, these will probably const 
                classes. For Java, this cannot be enforced for 
                classes.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>An out or in/out parameter in an operation will 
                become a referenced parameter in the method.</para>

                <para>For C++, these will be referenced non-const 
                parameters. For Java classes, this is the default. 
                Simple types (int, boolean) must, in java, be converted 
                to an object of a corresponding class (Integer, 
                Boolean).</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>The visibilities of the attributes, associations, 
                and operations will become visibilities on the member 
                variables or methods.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>Packages will become directories, namespaces, or

          <para>This conversion is not as straight-forward as the 
          conversion of the static structure. It is much more depending 
          on the target language and target platform.</para>

            In general it is only possible to say the following for

              <listitem>

                <para>A message is converted into a function

                <para>The class of the recipient will have to have a

                <para>The sender function in the class of the sender 
                will have a call to the function in the

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>An asynchronous message is converted to either 
                posting a message to be handled by some other thread or

            The following describes one possible way to generate state

            <itemizedlist>

              <listitem>

                <para>A State Machine is generated to a set of member

          <title>Button 1 Click</title>

          <para>Clicking on an user-interface object or on a diagram 
          artifact may establish many different things. Most of the 
          behaviour is experienced quite intuitive by the user, mainly 
          because the high degree of standardisation, even spanning 
          different computer platforms (Macintosh, PC, UNIX,...). 
          ArgoUML follows the <emphasis>Java Look and Feel Design 
          Guidelines</emphasis> by Sun. See 
          <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/"/>. Hence, 
          behaviour of common user-interface components is generally 
          not discussed in this document.</para>

          <para>On the other hand, mouse actions in a diagram may not 
          seem so intuitive to the user, since it is specific for 
          ArgoUML. Hence they are explained here. In short, clicking 
          selects or activates the object beneath the mouse-pointer, 
          and moves the focus (i.e. navigation).</para>

          <para>More in detail, the button 1 click may cause the 
          following result:</para>

          <sect3>

            <title>Selection</title>

            <para>Here button 1 is used to choose (select) an artifact

              sub-lists to an existing selection. ArgoUML does not

          <para>You can re-size panes by dragging on the divider bars

          changes shape when hovering over the divider bars.</para>

          <para>In addition you will see there are two small left 
          pointing arrows within the vertical divider bars, one at the 
          top of the vertical divider bar between explorer and editing 
          pane and one at the top of the vertical divider bar between 
          to-do pane and details pane. Button 1 click on the first of 
          these will expand the editing pane to the full width of the 
          window, button 1 click on the second will expand the details 
          pane to the full width of the window.</para>

          <para>There is also a small downward pointing arrow within 
          the horizontal divider bar at its leftmost end. Clicking on 
          this will expand the explorer and editing panes to the full 
          depth of the window.</para>

          <para>By using both the top arrow on the vertical divider and 
          the arrow on the horizontal divider, it is possible to expand 
          the editing pane to use the entire window.</para>

          <para>The original configuration can be restored by clicking

      <sect1>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>An important principle behind ArgoUML is that actions 
        should be able to be invoked in whatever way the user finds 
        convenient. As a result many (but not all) actions that can be 
        carried out on the menu can be carried out in other ways as 
        well under ArgoUML.</para>

        <para>A number of the common menu entries are also available 
        through keyboard shortcuts.</para>

        <para>It is also be possible to navigate the menu from the 
        keyboard. Each level of each menu is identified by a letter 
        (shown underlined in the menu or entry name from the moment the 
        ALT key is pressed). This sequence of letters while holding 
        down the ALT key selects the entry. 
        </para>

        <para>The following is an explanation of why the menuitems are 
        grouped as they are.</para>

        <para>

          <itemizedlist>

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>File</emphasis> menu contains 
              operations that affect on the whole project/file. All the 
              items in this menu can be explained as such.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>Edit</emphasis> menu is generally 
              intended for editing the model or changing the content of 
              a diagram. It also contains functions to enable editing, 
              like e.g. selecting. This menu is not intended for 
              diagram layout functions. Most functions here do 
              something with the selected modelelement and diagram. The 
              items &quot;Configure Perspectives...&quot;
              and &quot;Settings...&quot; are a bit different,
              since they adjust the way ArgoUML works - but they do not 
              belong in the File menu, since their settings are not
              stored in the project.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>View</emphasis> menu is for functions 
              that do never alter the model, nor the diagram layout, 
              only the way you view the diagram. A good example is
              &quot;zoom&quot;. 
              Also navigational functions belong here, e.g. &quot;Find&quot; 
              and &quot;Goto Diagram...&quot;. All changes of settings 
              in this menu apply to all diagrams (e.g. zoom).</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>Create</emphasis> menu contains all 
              possible diagrams that can be created. 
              These functions are
              context dependend, since they work on the 
              selected modelelement.

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>Arrange</emphasis> menu allows layout 
              changes in the current diagram, which is not the same as 
              the items in the View menu. Functions here can not alter 
              the UML model.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>Generation</emphasis> menu is for 
              Code Generation. The functions here work either on the 
              selected modelelements, or on the whole project.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>The <emphasis>Critique</emphasis> menu is specific

              which apply for all  projects.</para>

          <para>This initializes a new project within ArgoUML. The 
          project is created without a the name. It contains a 
          (top-level) <literal>Model</literal> named <literal>
          untitledModel</literal> and two empty diagrams: a class 
          diagram and a use case diagram.</para>

          <caution>

            <para><literal>untitledModel</literal> is not a 
            conventional model name (most processes suggest models 
            should be build from lower case letters). ArgoUML permits 
            you to use any case letters, but a critic will trigger to 
            warn that this is not conventional. See 
            <xref linkend="s1.ref.model"/> for a discussion of 
            this.</para>

          </caution>

          <para>If the model has been altered (as indicated by the 
          &quot;*&quot; in the titlebar of ArgoUML&apos;s window), then 
          activating the &quot;New&quot; function is potentionally not 
          the user&apos;s intention, since it will erase the changes. 
          Hence a confirmation dialog appears to allow the user to save 
          his work first, or cancel the operation completely.</para>

          <para>This menu-item allows you to throw away all your recent

          the file was saved.</para>

          <para>This menu-item is downlighted unless the currentproject

            <para><literal>Use guillemots</literal> (« ») for 
                stereotypes (clear by default). By default ArgoUML uses 
                pairs of <emphasis>less than</emphasis> and 
                <emphasis>greater than</emphasis> (&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;)

                stereotypes on diagrams are shown between true 
                guillemots (« »).</para>

            <para>This feature is presumably added to ArgoUML 
                because guillemots are poorly supported by various 
                fonts, and if they are present, then they are quite 
                small and poorly visible.</para>

                in the diagram.
                In UML the notation is "+" for public, "-" for private,
                "#" for protected, and "~" for package. 
                E.g. for an attribute, it may show:

                In UML notation, the multiplicity is shown between [], such as: 
                <literal>+newAttr [0..*] : int</literal>.
                This setting has no impact on showing multiplicity

                In UML notation, the initial value is shown e.g. like this:

                on a diagram with a shadow,
                for esthetical reasons. 
                Use this setting to adjust the 
                size of the shadow, used when the modelelement is created.
                The details tab "Presentation" allows to set the shadow per
                modelelement, after they are created, but ArgoUML V0.22 does
                not retain this latter change after save and load.

          <title>Select</title>

          <para>This sub-menu provides for selection of items on the 
          editing menu. It has the following entries.</para>

          <itemizedlist>

            <listitem>

              <para><literal>Select All</literal> (shortcut Ctrl-A). 
              <indexterm><primary>Select All</primary></indexterm> 
              <indexterm><primary>Shortcut 
              key</primary><secondary>Ctrl-A</secondary></indexterm> 
              Selects all artifacts on the current pane or in the 
              current field. The exact behaviour depends on the 
              <literal>current pane</literal> (i.e. the last one you 
              clicked in): explorer pane, editing pane, to-do pane, 
              details pane. One rule applies in all cases though: the 
              selection on the diagram (editing pane) and in the 
              explorer are always synchronised.</para>

              <para>If the editing pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: First everything in the explorer and on 
              the current diagram is deselected, and then everything 
              that is on the current diagram is selected (and if the 
              same items apear in the explorer, then they are also 
              there indicated as selected, because they are always 
              synchronised).</para>

              <para>If the explorer pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: All visible items in the explorer pane 
              are selected, and non-visible items are deselected.</para>

              <para>If the to-do pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: All visible items in the to-do pane are 
              selected, and non-visible items are deselected. In fact, 
              this works the same as for the explorer pane, because 
              both are tree structures.</para>

              <para>If the details pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: The function only works when the cursor 
              is in certain fields, where selecting is possible, e.g. a 
              Name field. In such a case, the Select All function 
              extends the current selection to the whole field 
              contents.</para>

              <para>A text box labeled <literal>In Diagram:</literal>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>To the right of these two text boxes, a selector

          <para>The top half is labeled <literal>Search

          <para>Button 1 click on any row will give more information on

          <para>The bottom half of the tab is a table labeled <literal>

            <para>Enlarging the dialog vertically shows that the

            Search results part. However, between them is a divider 
            line and when hovering over this line, the mouse pointer 
            changes into a sizing icon, and the border between these 2 
            areas can be moved up or down to redistribute the space in 
            the window.</para>

            <para>This dialog box is not modal, which allows it to

          New Sequence Diagram</title>

          If a class is 
          currently selected, a sequence diagram and a collaboration
          will be created
          that represent the behaviour of that class. 
          This means that the created elements 
          will be shown within the class in the 
          explorer hierarchy (under Package-centric view) and artifacts 
          created on the diagram will be created within the namespace 
          of the collaboration. A sequence diagram may 
          not only represent the behavior of a class, but 
          also of any other classifier, such as interface, use case, etc.
          It is also possible to make sequence diagrams for an operation.

        <para>This menu controls one of ArgoUML&apos;s unique

          <para>A word about terminology: The 
          <emphasis>critics</emphasis> are background processes, which 
          evaluate the current model according to various 
          <quote>good</quote> design criteria. There is one critic for 
          every design criterion.</para>

          <para>The output of a critic is a 
          <emphasis>critique</emphasis>—a statement about some aspect 
          of the model that does not appear to follow good design 
          practice.</para>

          <para>Finally a critique will generally suggest how the bad 
          design issue it has identified can be rectified, by raising a 
          <emphasis>to-do item</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>The critics run as asynchronous processes in parallel

          there are three columns, labeled <literal>Active</literal>, 
          <literal>Headline</literal> and <literal>Snoozed</literal>. 
          The first of these is a check box, which may be toggled with 
          button 1 click. The second is the headline name of the 
          critic, the third indicates if the critic has been snoozed 
          from the to-do pane (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.todopane"/>. A 
          critic is only really active if the box in the first column 
          is checked <emphasis>and</emphasis> the critic has not been 
          snoozed.</para>

          <para>Any critic for which the box in the first column is 
          unchecked is inactive and will not trigger. In addition any 
          to-do items associated with that critic will be removed from 
          the to-do pane.</para>

          <para>The V0.20 version of ArgoUML has a total of 90 critics, 
          a few of which are incompletely implemented. They are 
          described in detail by design issue category in the chapter 
          on critics (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.critics"/>).</para>

          <para>To the right of the list are a series of fields, titled 
          <literal>Critic Details</literal>, giving detailed control 
          over individual critics. Selecting a critic in the list on 
          the left will populate the fields for that critic.</para>

          <para>The first field on the right is titled <literal>Critic 
          Class:</literal> and then the full name of the class in 
          ArgoUML that implements the critic. This name can be used as 
          unique identifier of the critique, e.g. in conversations 
          about the critic.</para>

          <para>The first field below this title is a text box labeled

          left).</para>

          <note>

            <para>In the headline you may see the text <literal>
            &lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be 
            replaced by the name of the artifact in question when the 
            critic is triggered.</para>

          </note>

          <para>The next field is a drop-down selector, labeled 
          <literal>Priority:</literal>. The three options available are 
          <literal>High</literal>, <literal>Medium</literal> and 
          <literal>Low</literal> and specify the priority category of 
          any to-do item generated by this critic. This does not alter 
          the priority of the already existing todo items, only the 
          newly generated ones. Changing the priority of a critic is 
          not saved persistently.</para>

          Always</literal>, <literal>If Only One</literal> and <literal>
          Never</literal>.</para>

          <para>Clarifiers are the icons and wavy red underlines drawn 
          on the actual diagrams to indicate the artefact to which the 
          critic refers. The original intention was to make the mapping 
          from critics to clarifiers somewhat customizable.</para>

          <para>For example one user might make a <literal>Missing 
          Name</literal> critic show a red underline, another user 
          might turn off the clarifier, or have it draw a wavy green 
          underline or a blue questionmark. Critics with their 
          clarifier&apos;s disabled would still produce feedback that 
          is listed in the to-do pane.</para>

          <caution>

            <para>In the V0.20 release of ArgoUML this selector has no 
            function whatsoever. It is for future development.</para>

              <para>The idea of a critic network is that they would be 
              a state machine like diagram with several steps. Each 
              step would express a condition which, collectively with 
              the other steps associated with that critic, articulates 
              the <quote>rule</quote> that the critic is providing. If 
              the rule fires, then remaining steps would define the 
              steps of the wizard to help the user fix the 
              problem.</para>

              <para>The ideas behind this are discussed in Chapter 4 of

              related discussion.</para>

              <para>A suggested implementation is that the conditions 
              could be written in OCL against the UML meta-model. A 
              library of predefined conditions and steps would allow 
              end-users to build new critics by combining those in 
              novel ways.</para>

        <para>The explorer allows the user to view the structure of the

        the user to define their own perspetives for custom exploring 
        of the model.</para>

        <para>An important feature, related to the cognitive psychology 
        ideas behind ArgoUML is that not all artifacts are necessarily 
        shown in all perspectives. Rather, the perspectives are used to 
        implement hiding of uninteresting parts of the model.</para>

          <para>If you hover the mouse over the horizontal line that

            <listitem>

              <para><literal>New</literal>. This creates a new

              <para><literal>Duplicate</literal>. This creates a copy 
              the selected perspective so it can be used as the basis 
              of a new perspective. The new one is named &quot;Copy 
              of&quot; followed by the original name.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para><literal>Move Up</literal>. This moves the selected

              downlighted for the topmost perspective.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para><literal>Move Down</literal>. This moves the 
              selected perspective one place down in the list. This 
              button is downlighted for the last perspective.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para><literal>Restore Defaults</literal>. This restores 
              all perspectives and their selected rules to the build-in 
              defaults of ArgoUML.</para>

            </listitem>

          </itemizedlist>

          <para>At the very bottom right is a button labeled <literal>
          OK</literal> to be used when all changes are complete. 
          button 1 click on this button will close the dialog window. 
          The changes are saved when you exit ArgoUML (or inmediately 
          by activating the menuitem File-&gt;Save Configuration) in 
          the <literal>argo.user.properties</literal> file.</para>

          <para>Then there is the <literal>Cancel</literal> button, 
          which cancels all changes made in the dialog. Pressing the 
          dialog close icon (usually at the top right corner) has the 
          same effect as pressing the cancel button.</para>

          <title>The Explorer Panes</title>

          <para>The explorer was conceived as being able to offer 
          multiple views simultaneously, with up to three panels of 
          hierarchy. A dialog offers control of these panels, with an 
          option to show or not show each panel, and the option of the 
          second and third panels to be rooted at the selection on the 
          previous panel, or to show the previously used 
          hierarchy.</para>

          <caution>

            <para>This functionality is not yet implemented in ArgoUML. 
            The dialog is never shown.</para>

          </caution>

          <para>When using the explorer, it is worth bearing in mind 
          that this is a useful visualization of the model, it is not 
          <emphasis>solely</emphasis> for navigation and selection. It 
          is also useful for users to easily (meaning a few mouse 
          clicks without having to arrange a diagram) visualize the 
          model structured according to some perspective. For example, 
          show me the state nesting, or show me the class inheritance 
          tree, or show me the package nesting, or show me the list of 
          actors.</para>

          <para>The idea with the second and third explorer tree panes, 
          is that sometimes it is easier to explore the tree to a 
          certain level in one tree and then continue expanding in a 
          second tree. Since each tree will not be so deep, it will 
          look more like a list.</para>

          <para>For example, look at the way javadocs are viewed with 
          frames: the packages are selected from one list, and 
          interfaces, classes, and exceptions in that package are shown 
          in a second pane. In the case of javadocs, the second pane 
          has a tree with three roots that are always expanded, but it 
          is visually presented as three lists with three 
          headers.</para>

          <para>The other suggested use of a second or third nav panel 
          is to list recently visited model elements. This is simliar 
          to the recently visited files listed on the <literal>
          File</literal> menu of most applications, but for model 
          elements rather than files.</para>

          <para>The motivtion is the fact that designers frequently 
          <quote>interrupt</quote> themselves: they are thinking of 
          working on one part of the design, and then they make a 
          decision that needs a change in some other part, and then 
          that has an implication on some other part, and... and... and... 
          the designer forgets what it was they were originally trying 
          to accomplish. They need to <quote>pop their mental 
          stack</quote> to come back to finish what the started. If 
          they fail to do that, they leave half-finished fragments all 
          over the design which always seem to come out as soon as it 
          is presented to someone else.</para>

          <para>A recently visited list should be LIFO (stack) ordered, 
          or FIFO (queue) ordered. The goal would be to help designers 
          come back to finish what they were doing, or simply to help 
          them switch between two or three related parts of the design. 
          The <literal>Navigate Back</literal> and <literal>Navigate 
          Forward</literal> buttons in the toolbar serve the same basic 
          purpose and use a lot less screen space.</para>

          <para>Tear-off tabs would also help with alternating between 
          views, but sometimes users don&apos;t want to work with so 
          many separate windows.</para>

          <para>This is the theory that motivates the idea of multiple 
          nav panes. For more information see Jason Robbins&apos; PhD 
          dissertation 
          <ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/">
          http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</ulink>. 
          One practical usability concern is available screen space and 
          another is visual complexity. For this reason the multiple 
          panes have yet to be implemented in ArgoUML while more 
          pressing issues are addressed.</para>

        <title>Context Sensitive Menu</title>

        <para>Button 2 Click over any selected artifact in the main

          <title>Add to Diagram</title>

          <para>This entry on the pop-up menu appears for any artifact 
          that could be added to the diagram in the editing pane.</para>

          <para>The item can be placed in a diagram by moving the 
          cursor to the editing pane or a spawned editing pane window 
          (where it will appear as a cross) and clicking 
          button 1.</para>

          <caution>

            <para>This menu entry only appears as not grayed out, if 
            the diagram in the editor pane allows to contain the 
            artifact, and the artifact is not present yet in the 
            diagram. ArgoUML will not let you place more than one copy 
            of any particular artifact on a diagram.</para>

          Delete From Model</title>

          <para>This entry on the pop-up menu appears for any artifact 
          that could be deleted from the model.</para>

          <warning>

            <para>This deletes the artifact from the model completely, 
            not just from the diagram. To remove the artifact just from 
            the diagram, use the edit menu (see

          </warning>

          <caution>

            <para>You can delete a diagram from the model. Depending on 
            the type of diagram, that might delete all artifacts shown 
            on the diagram. To illustrate the differences, consider the

              <listitem>

                <para>Deleting a class diagram does not delete any 
                artifact drawn on it. All artifacts that were shown on 
                the diagram remain present in the model. This because a 
                class diagram does not &quot;map&quot; on any artifact 
                according the UML standard V1.4.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>

                <para>Deleting a statechart diagram also deletes the 
                statemachine it represents, and hence also all the 
                artifacts owned by the statemachine. This because a 
                statechart diagram does &quot;map&quot; into a 
                StateMachine according the UML standard V1.4.</para>

          <title>Button 1 Click</title>

          <para>In the tool bar of the editing pane, button 1 click is 
          used to select a tool for creating a new artifact and adding 
          it to the diagram (see double clicking for creating multiple 
          artifacts). For most tools, adding a new artifact to the 
          diagram is achieved by moving the mouse into the editing area 
          and clicking again.</para>

          <para>In the main editing area button 1 click is used to 
          select an individual artifact.</para>

          <para>Many artifacts (e.g. actor, class) show special handles 
          when selected and the mouse hovers over them. These are 
          called <quote>Selection Action Buttons</quote>, see 
          <xref linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_selection_action_buttons"/>. 
          They appear at the sides, top and bottom, and indicate a 
          relationship type. Clicking on a Selection Action Button 
          creates a new related artifact, with the relation of the type 
          that was indicated. If the shift key is pressed when hovering 
          the mouse over a selected artifact, sometimes different 
          handles are shown, which stand for different relation 
          types.</para>

          <para>Where button 2 click has been used to bring up a 
          context sensitive pop-up menu (see below), button 1 click is 
          used to select the menu entry required. The pop-up menu will 
          be removed by any button 1 click outside of the menu 
          area.</para>

          <para>There are various more detailed effects, which are 
          discussed under the descriptions of the various tools (see

          <para>When used on the tool bar with a tool to add an

          to the drawing area, once for each further button click, 
          until the tool is again selected or another tool 
          chosen.</para>

          <para>When used within the drawing area on an artifact that

          <title>Button 1 Motion</title>

          <!-- This has never worked AFAIK!
          <para>When adding an artifact using the toolbar, button 1 
          motion can generally be used to define the size of the new 
          artifact. Its dimensions (line ends, diagonal corners of a 
          rectangular artifact etc) are defined by button 1 down and 
          button 1 up.</para>
          -->

          <para>Where the artifact being added is some form of 
          connector its termination point is shown with button 1 up 
          over the terminating artifact. button 1 click may be used in 
          the space between artifacts to create articulation points in 
          the connector. This is particularly useful where connectors 
          must loopback on themselves.</para>

          <para>Over graphical artifacts button 1 motion will move the 
          artifact to a new position.</para>

          <para>Graphical artifacts that are selected show handles at 
          the corners or ends, and these can be used for 
          re-sizing.</para>

          <para>Some artifacts (e.g. actor, class) show special handles 
          (called <quote>Selection Action Buttons</quote>, see 
          <xref linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_selection_action_buttons"/>) 
          at the sides, top and bottom, which can be dragged to form 
          types of relationship with other artifacts.</para>

          <para>Where the artifact is some form of connector between 
          other items, button 1 motion other than at a handle will 
          cause a new handle to be created, allowing the connector to 
          be articulated at that point. This only works when the 
          connecting line is not straight angled. Such new handles can 
          be removed by moving them to the end of the connector.</para>

          <para>There are various more detailed effects, which are 
          discussed under the descriptions of the various tools (see

          are highlighted (but not selected) and sub-menus exposed by

          selection is with button 1 or button 2. See

        Press the symbol at the right of the tool to pop it open.
        These drop-down tools remember their last used tool persistently. 
        This means that when ArgoUML starts, 
        they show the last tool that was activated

              <literal>Stereotype</literal>.
              These two have similar handles, 
              except the one at the top of a stereotype: 
              when clicked, it creates a metaclass, 
              connected by a dependency marked with «stereotype».
              This eases the creation of "stereotype declaration" diagrams - 
              see the literature on the subject.

        <title>The Broom</title>

        <para>ArgoUML&apos;s broom alignment tool is specialized to 
        support the needs of designers in achieving the kind of 
        alignment used in UML diagrams. It is common for designers to 
        roughly align objects as they are created or by using simple 
        movement commands. The broom is an easy way to precisely align 
        objects that are already roughly aligned. Furthermore, the 
        broom&apos;s distribution options are suited to the needs of 
        UML designers: making related objects appear evenly spaced, 
        packing objects to save diagram space, and spreading objects 
        out to make room for new objects. The broom also makes it easy 
        to change from horizontal to vertical alignment or from 
        left-alignment to right-alignment.</para>

        <para>The T-shaped icon in ArgoUML&apos;s diagram toolbar 
        invokes the broom alignment tool. When the mouse button 1 is 
        pressed while in broom-mode, the designer&apos;s initial mouse 
        movement orients the broom to face in one of four directions: 
        north, south, east, or west. After that, mouse drag events 
        cause the broom to advance in the chosen direction, withdraw, 
        or grow in a lateral direction. Like a real-world push broom, 
        the broom tool pushes diagram elements that come in contact 
        with it. This has the effect of aligning objects along the face 
        of the broom and provides immediate visual feedback (see the 
        figure below). Unlike a real-world broom, moving backwards 
        allows diagram elements to return to their original position. 
        Growing the broom makes it possible to align objects that are 
        not near each other. When the mouse button is released, the 
        broom disappears and the moved objects are selected to make it 
        easy to manipulate them further.</para>

        <para>If the designer presses the space bar while using the 
        broom, objects on the face of the broom are distributed (i.e., 
        spaced evenly). ArgoUML&apos;s broom supports three 
        distribution modes: objects can be spaced evenly across the 
        space that they use, objects can be packed together with only a 
        small gap between them, or objects can be distributed evenly 
        over the entire length of the broom&apos;s face. Repeatedly 
        pressing the space bar cycles among these three distribution 
        modes and displays a brief message indicating the operation 
        just performed: Space evenly, Pack tightly, Spread out and 
        Original.</para>

        <para>Selection-action buttons offer common operations on the 
        selected object. For example, a class node has a button at 
        12-o&apos;clock for adding a superclass, one at 6-o&apos;clock 
        for adding a subclass, and buttons at 3-o&apos;clock and 
        9-o&apos;clock for adding associations. These buttons support a 
        &quot;click or drag&quot; interaction: a single click creates a 
        new related class at a default position relative to the 
        original class and creates a generalization or association; a 
        drag from the button to an existing class creates only the 
        generalization or association; and, a drag to an empty space in 
        the diagram creates a new class at the mouse position and the 
        generalization or association. ArgoUML provides some automated 
        layout support so that clicking the subclass button will 
        position the new classes so that they do not overlap.</para>

        <para>Selection-action buttons are transparent. They have a 
        visibly recognizable rectangular shape and size and they 
        contain an icon that is the same as the icon used for the 
        corresponding type of design element on the standard toolbar. 
        However, these icons are unfilled line drawings with many 
        transparent pixels. This allows selection-action buttons to be 
        overlaid onto the drawing area without overly obscuring the 
        diagram itself. Also, the buttons are only drawn when the mouse 
        is over the selected artifact; if any part of the diagram is 
        obscured, the mouse can simply be moved away to get a clearer 
        view of the diagram.</para>

            reached from the property tab of the association - and the 
            diagram does not show any arrows in this case.</para>

            <para>This is considered bad design practice (it will

        <para>Also, the status bar of ArgoUML 
        (i.e. the small area at the bottom of the ArgoUML window),

        Text entry can be concluded by pressing F2, 
        or for single-line fields, by pressing the enter key.
        Additionally, editing can be concluded by 
        clicking somewhere in the diagram outside the edit area.

        <para>Editing notation on the diagram is a very powerful way
        to enter a lot of model-information in a very compact way. 
        It is e.g. possible to create an operation,

        all parameters and their types, 
        and operation properties (visibility, concurrency), all

            <literal>Resolve Item...</literal> This pops up a dialog

            an important dialog, because it allows you to deal with 
            to-do items in ways other than the recommendation of the 
            to-do item (which is the whole point of their being 
            advisory).</para>

            <para>This dialog box is intended to be used for the 
            following reasons: deleting todo items that were manually 
            created, preventing a single critic to trigger on a single 
            object, and dismissing categories of todo items by lowering 
            design concerns or design goals.</para>

        <para>At the top left is the icon and name of the type of 
        artifact (i.e. the UML metaclass, not the actual name of this 
        particular artifact). In this example the property tab is for a 
        class.</para>

        <para>To the right of this is a toolbar of icons relevant to 
        this property tab. The first one is always navigation <literal>
        Go up</literal>. The last is always <literal>Delete</literal> 
        to delete the selected artifact from the model. The ones in 
        between depend on the artifact.</para>

        <para>The remainder of the tab comprises fields, laid out in 
        two or three columns. Each field has a label to its left. The 
        fields may be text boxes, text areas, drop down selectors, 
        radio boxes and check boxes. In most (but not all cases) the 
        values can be changed. In the case of text boxes this is 
        sometimes by just typing the required value.</para>

        <para>However for many text boxes and text areas, data entry is 
        via a context sensitive pop-up menu (using button 2 click), 
        which offers options to add a new entry, delete an entry or 
        move entries up and down (in text areas with multiple 
        entries).</para>

        <para>The first field is almost always a text field <literal>
        Name</literal>, where the name of the specific artifact can be 
        entered. The remaining fields vary depending on the artifact 
        selected.</para>

        <para>The detailed property sheets for all ArgoUML artifacts 
        are discussed in separate chapters for each of the diagram 
        types (use case diagram (<xref linkend="ch.ref.entusecase"/>, 
        class diagram (<xref linkend="ch.ref.entclass"/>, sequence 
        diagram (<xref linkend="ch.ref.entseq"/>, statechart diagram (

        artifacts that are common to all diagram types have their own 
        chapter (<xref linkend="ch.ref.entities"/>).</para>

        <caution>

          <para>ArgoUML will always try to squeeze all fields on to the 
          property sheet. If the size of the property tab is too small, 
          it may become unusable. The solution is to either enlarge the 
          property tab by enlarging the main window, or by moving the 
          dividers to left and top.</para>

        <para>Within the UML 1.4 standard, all artifacts are children

        <title>Constraints Tab</title>

        <para>Constraints are one of the extension mechanisms provided 
        for UML. ArgoUML is equipped with a powerful constraint editor 
        based on the <emphasis>Object Constraint Language 
        (OCL)</emphasis> defined in the UML 1.4 standard.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>The OCL editor implementation for ArgoUML V0.20 
          doesn&apos;t support OCL constraints for elements other than 
          Classes and Features.</para>

          <para>This is something of a general restriction of OCL. 
          Although the UML specification claims that there may be a 
          constraint for every model element, the OCL specification 
          only defines classes/interfaces and operations as allowable 
          contexts.</para>

          <para>It is not before OCL 2.0 that a more general definition 
          of allowable contexts is introduced. The key issue is that 
          for each context definition you need to define what is the 
          contextualClassifier, i.e., the classifier that will be 
          associated with the self keyword. The creators of the OCL 
          specification claim that this is not an issue for the OCL 
          specification, but rather for UML or some integration task 
          force. Conversely, it seems that the UML specification people 
          seem to expect this to be defined in the OCL specification 
          (which is why we did a first step in that direction in OCL 
          2.0).</para>

          <para>So, to cut a long story short, it appeared that the 
          simplest solution for ArgoUML at the moment would be to 
          enable the OCL property panel only for those model elements 
          for which there actually exists a definition of the 
          contextualClassifier in OCL 1.4. These are (s. above) 
          Class/Interface and Feature.</para>

        </caution>

        <para>The standard pre-defines a small number of constraints 
        (for example the <literal>xor</literal> constraint over a set 
        of associations indicating that only one may be manifest for 
        any particular instance).</para>

        <para>The standard also envisages a number of circumstances 
        where general purpose constraints may be useful:</para>

            for the currently selected artifact.</para>

            <warning>

              <para>It seems logical, that when a new constraint is 
              created, it needs to be edited. But ArgoUML V0.20 fails 
              to start the OCL editor upon creation; you have to do 
              this by primo selecting the new constraint first, secundo 
              rename it, and tertio press the <literal>Edit 
              Constraint</literal> button. It is essental for 
              successfully creating a constraint to follow these 4 
              steps accurately: create, select, rename, edit. The step 
              to rename is necessary, because the validity check will 
              refuse the constraint if its name differs from the name 
              mentioned in the constraint text. For the same reason, 
              renaming a constraint afterwards is impossible.</para>

        <title>Tagged Values Tab</title>

        <para>Tagged values are another extension mechanism provided by 
        UML. The user can define name-value pairs to be associated with 
        artifacts which define properties of that artifact. The names 
        are known as <emphasis>tags</emphasis>. UML pre-defines a 
        number of tags that are useful for many of its artifacts.</para>

        <note>

          <para>The tag <literal>documentation</literal> is defined for 
          the top UML metaclass, <literal>Element</literal> and is so 
          available to all artifacts. In ArgoUML documentation values 
          are provided through the <literal>Documentation</literal> 
          tab, rather than by using the <literal>
          Tagged Values</literal> tab.</para>

        </note>

        <para>The <literal>Tagged Values</literal> tab in ArgoUML 
        comprises a two column table, with a combo-box on 
        the left to select the tagdefinition
        and an editable box on the right for 
        the associated value. There is always at least one empty row 
        available for any new tag. 
        </para>
        
        <para>The button at the top of this tab allows creation of a new 
        tagdefinition. 
        After clicking this button, go to the properties tab first

        <title>Checklist Tab</title>

        <para>Conducting design reviews and inspections is one of the 
        most effective ways of detecting errors during software 
        development. A design review typically consists of a small 
        number of designers, implementers, or other project 
        stakeholders holding a meeting to review a software development 
        artifact. Many development organizations have developed 
        checklists of common design problems for use in design review 
        meetings. Recent research indicated that reviewers inspecting 
        code without meeting, makeing use of these checklists, are just 
        as effective as design review meetings.</para>

        <para>Hence, a checklist feature has been added to ArgoUML, 
        that is much in the spirit of design review checklists. 
        However, ArgoUML&apos;s checklists are integrated into the 
        design tool user interface and the design task.</para>

        <para>A software designer using ArgoUML can see a review 
        checklist for any design element. The <quote>Checklist</quote> 
        tab presents a list of check-off items that is appropriate to 
        the currently selected design element. For example, when a 
        class is selected in a design diagram, the checklist tab shows 
        items that prompt critical thinking about classes. See the 
        figure below. Designers may check off items as they consider 
        them. Checked items are kept in the list to show what has 
        already been considered, while unchecked items prompt the 
        designer to consider new design issues. ArgoUML supplies many 
        different checklists with many possible items.</para>

        <para>The key feature that distinguishes ArgoUML from other UML

        The theory behind this is well described in Jason Robbins&apos;

        <para>Critics are one of the main ways in which these ideas are 
        implemented. Running in the background they offer advice to the 
        designer which may be accepted or ignored. A key point is that 
        they do not <emphasis>impose</emphasis> a decision on the

          <para>The <emphasis>critics</emphasis> are background 
          processes, which evaluate the current model according to 
          various <quote>good</quote> design criteria. There is one 
          critic for every design criterion.</para>

          <para>The output of a critic is a

          <title>Design Issues</title>

          <para>ArgoUML categorizes critics according the the design 
          issue they address (some critics may be in more than one 
          category). At present there are 16 such categories.</para>

        <sect2 id="critics.CrNonAggDataType">

          <title>Wrap DataType</title>

          <para>DataTypes are not full classes within UML 1.4. They can 
          only have enumeration literals as values, and only support 
          <literal>query</literal> operations (that is operations that 
          do not change the DataType&apos;s state).</para>

          <para>DataTypes cannot be associated with classes, unless the 
          DataType is part of a composite (black diamond) aggregation. 
          Such an association relects the tight binding of a collection 
          of DataType instances to a class instance. In effect such a 
          DataType is an attribute of the class with 
          multiplicity.</para>

          <para>Good OOA&amp;D depends on careful choices about which 
          entities to represent as full objects and which to represent

          <para>Suggestion to improve readability by having fewer

          <para>Two operations in &lt;artifact&gt; have the same

          parameters has the same type.</para>

          <para>Where there are conflicting signatures, correct code

          <para>Only if these all match in both type and order, will

          <note>

            <para>Some purists would argue that the comparison should

        <title>Design Patterns</title>

        <para>Critics concerning design pattern usage in ArgoUML.</para>

        <para>These relate to the use of patterns as described by the 
        so called <quote>Gang of Four</quote>. ArgoUML also uses this 
        category for critics associated with deployment and sequence 
        diagrams. The current version of ArgoUML has the following 
        critics in this category.</para>

        <sect2 id="critics.CrConsiderSingleton">

          <title>Consider using Singleton Pattern for 
          &lt;class&gt;</title>

          <para>The <emphasis>class</emphasis> has no non-static 
          attributes nor any associations that are navigable away from 
          instances of this class. This means that every instance of 
          this class will be identical to every other instance, since 
          there will be nothing about the instances that can 
          differentiate them.</para>

          <para>Under these circumstances you should consider making 
          explicit that you have exactly one instance of this class, by 
          using the singleton Pattern. Using the singleton pattern can 
          save time and memory space. Within ArgoUML this can be done 
          by using the «singleton» stereotype on this class.</para>

          <para>If it is not your intent to have a single instance, you 
          should define instance variables (i.e. non-static attributes) 
          and/or outgoing associations that will represent differences 
          bewteen instances.</para>

          <para>Having specified <emphasis>class</emphasis> as a 
          singleton, you need to define the class so there can only be 
          a single instance. This will complete the information 
          representation part of your design. To achieve this you need 
          to do the following.</para>

          <orderedlist>

            <listitem>

              <para>You must define a static attribute (a class 
              variable) holding the instance. This must therefore have 
              <emphasis>class</emphasis> as its type.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>You must have only private constructors so that new 
              instances cannot be made by other code. The creation of 
              the single instance could be through a suitable helper 
              operation, which invokes this private constructor just 
              once.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              <para>You must have at least one constructor to override 
              the default constructor, so that the default constructor 
              is not used to create multiple instances.</para>

          </orderedlist>

          <para>This class is marked with the «singleton» stereotype, 
          but it does not satisfy the constraints imposed on singletons 
          (ArgoUML will also accept «Singleton» stereotype as defining 
          a singleton). A singleton class can have at most one 
          instance. This means that the class must meet the design 
          criteria for a singleton (see 
          <xref linkend="critics.CrConsiderSingleton"/>).</para>

          <para>Whenever you mark a class with a stereotype, the class 
          should satisfy all constraints of the stereotype. This is an 
          important part of making a self-consistent and understangle 
          design. Using the singleton pattern can save time and memory 
          space.</para>

          <para>If you no longer want this class to be a singleton, 
          remove the «singleton» stereotype by clicking on the class 
          and selecting the blank selection on the stereotype drop-down 
          within the properties tab.</para>

          <title>Two Aggregate Ends (Roles) in Binary 
          Association</title>

          <para>Only one end (role) of a binary association can be 
          aggregate or composite. This a well-formedness rule of the 
          UML 1.4 standard.</para>

          <para>Aggregation and composition are used to indicate 
          whole-part relationships, and by definition, the 
          <quote>part</quote> end cannot be aggregate.</para>

          <para>To fix this, identify the <quote>part</quote> end of 
          the association, and use the critic wizard (the <literal>
          Next&gt;</literal> button, or manually set its aggregation to 
          <literal>none</literal> using the button 2 pop-up menu or the 
          property sheet.</para>

          <para>Composition (more correctly called composite 
          aggregation) is used where there is a whole-part relationship 
          that is one-to-one or one-to-many, and the lifetime of the 
          part is inextricably tied to the lifetime of the whole. 
          Instances of the whole will have responsibility for creating 
          and destroying instances of the associated part. This also 
          means that a class can only be a part in one composite 
          aggregation.</para>

          <para>An example of a composite aggregation might be a 
          database of cars and their wheels. This is a one-to-four 
          relationship, and the database entry for a wheel is 
          associated with its car. When the car ceases to exist in the 
          database, so do its wheels.</para>

          <para>Aggregation (more correctly called shared aggregation) 
          is used where there is a whole-part relationship, that does 
          not meet the criteria for a composite aggregation. An example 
          might be a database of university courses and the students 
          that attend them. There is a whole-part relationship between 
          courses and students. However there is no lifetime 
          relationship between students and course (a student continues 
          to exist even after a course is finished) and the 
          relationship is many-to-many.</para>

          <para>Aggregation and composition are used to indicate

        <para>Datatypes can be thought of as simple classes. They have 
        no attributes, and any operations on them must have no 
        side-effects. A useful analogy is primitive datatypes in a 
        language like Java. The integer <quote>3</quote> stands on its 
        own—it has no inner structure. There are operations (for 
        example addition) on the integers, but when I perform <literal>
        3 + 4</literal> the result is a new number, <quote>3</quote> 
        and <quote>4</quote> are unchanged by the exercise.</para>

        <para>Within UML 1.3, <literal>DataType</literal> is a 
        sub-class of the <literal>Classifier</literal> metaclass. It 
        embraces the predefined primitive types (
        <literal>byte</literal>, <literal>char</literal>, <literal>
        double</literal>, <literal>float</literal>, <literal>
        int</literal>, <literal>long</literal> and <literal>
        short</literal>), the predefined enumeration, <literal>
        boolean</literal> and user defined <emphasis>enumeration 
        types</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Within ArgoUML new datatypes may be created using the

                  the attribute property sheet should be ignored.</para>

        <para>Enumeration can be thought of as simple classes. They have 
        no attributes, and any operations on them must have no 
        side-effects. A useful analogy is primitive datatypes in a 
        language like Java. The boolean <quote>true</quote> stands on its 
        own—it has no inner structure. There are operations (for 
        example logical xor) on the booleans, but when I perform <literal>
        true xor true</literal> the result is a new boolean, 
        and the original 2 booleans <quote>true</quote> 
        are unchanged by the exercise.</para>

        <para>Within UML 1.4, <literal>Enumeration</literal> is a 
        sub-class of the <literal>DataType</literal> metaclass.  
        </para>

        <para>The big difference with other DataTypes, is that an
        Enumeration has <literal>EnumerationLiteral</literal>s. 
        E.g. the Enumeration <quote>boolean</quote> is defined as
        having 2 EnumerationLiterals, <quote>true</quote> and
        <quote>false</quote>.
        </para>

        <para>Within ArgoUML new enumerations may be created using the 
        <literal>New Enumeration</literal> button on the property tabs of 
        the model and packages (in which case the new enumeration is 
        restricted in scope to the package), as well as the properties 
        tab for datatype and enumeration.</para>

        <note>

          <para>UML 1.4 allows user defined datatypes to be placed on 
          class diagrams. This is not yet possible in ArgoUML.</para>

          <title>ArgoUML Limitations Concerning Use Case 
          Diagrams</title>

          <para>Use case diagrams are now well supported within 
          ArgoUML. There still are some minor limitations though. One 
          is that extension points may be shown in a separate 
          compartment on the use case, but this is not retained after 
          saving and reloading.</para>

          <note>

            <para>Earlier versions of ArgoUML (0.9 and earlier) 
            implemented extend and include relationships by using a 
            stereotyped dependency relationship. Although such diagrams 
            will show correctly on the diagram, they will not link 
            correctly to the use cases, and should be replaced by 
            proper extend and include relationships using the current 
            system.</para>

        <para>Generalization is a relationship between two use cases or 
        two actors. Where A is a generalization of B, it means A 
        describes more general behavior and B a more specific version

        <para>Examples for a travel agent sales system might be the use 
        case for making a booking as a generalization of the use case 
        for making a flight booking and a salesman actor being a 
        generalization of a supervisor actor (since supervisors can 
        also act as salesmen, but not vice versa).</para>

        <para>Generalization is analogous to class inheritance within

          <para>It is easy to confuse <emphasis>extends</emphasis> 
          relationships between use cases with generalization. However 
          extends is about augmenting a use case&apos;s behavior at a

        <indexterm><primary>Extend Relationship</primary></indexterm>
        <para>Extend is a relationship between two use cases. Where A 
        extends B, it means A describes more specific behavior and B 
        the general version of that behavior.</para>

        <para>In many respects extend is like generalization. However 
        the key difference is that the extended use case defines 
        <emphasis>extension points</emphasis> (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.extension_point"/>), which are the only 
        places where its behavior may be extended. The extending use 
        case must define at which of these extension points it adds 
        behavior.</para>

        <para>This makes the use of extend more tightly controlled than 
        general extension, and it is thus preferred wherever 
        possible.</para>

        <para>Examples for a travel agent sales system might be the use 
        case for paying for a ticket, which has an extension point in 
        the specification of the payment. Extending use cases may then 
        extend at this point to pay by cash, credit card etc.</para>

        <para>Within the UML metamodel, <literal>Extend</literal> is a 
        sub-class of <literal>Relationship</literal>.</para>

        <para>An extend relationship is represented as a dotted link

        «extend»</literal>. If a condition is defined, it is shown

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created 
        within a class diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of 
        artifacts on the diagram may not actually themselves appear on 
        the diagram.</para>

        <para>Class diagrams are used for only one of the UML static 
        structure diagrams, the class diagram itself. Object diagrams 
        are represented on the ArgoUML deployment diagram.</para>

        <para>In addition, ArgoUML uses the class diagram to show model 
        structure through the use of packages.</para>

        <para>There is a close relationship between this material and 
        the Properties Tab of the Details Pane (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers 
        Properties in general, in this chapter they are linked to 
        specific artifacts.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="fig.ref.class_diagram"/> shows a class 
        diagram with all possible artifacts displayed.</para>

          <title>Limitations Concerning Class Diagrams in 
          ArgoUML</title>

          <para>The current implementation does not allow datatypes to 
          be shown on class diagrams.</para>

          <para>A variant of the class diagram within the UML standard 
          is the <emphasis>object diagram</emphasis>. There is 
          currently no support for objects or links within ArgoUML 
          Class diagrams;. Instead the ArgoUML deployment diagram does 
          have both objects and links, and can be used to draw object 
          diagrams.</para>

        <title>Package</title>

        <indexterm><primary>Package</primary></indexterm>
        <para>The package is the main organizational artifact within 
        ArgoUML. In the UML metamodel it is a sub-class of both 
        <literal>Namespace</literal> and <literal>
        GeneralizableElement</literal>.</para>

        <note>

          <para>ArgoUML also implements the UML <literal>
          Model</literal> artifact as a sub-class of package, but 
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> the <literal>Subsystem</literal> 
          artifact.</para>

        </note>

        <para>ArgoUML also implements some less common aspects of UML 
        model management. In particular the relationship UML 1.4 
        defines as <literal>Generalization</literal> and the sub-class 
        dependency <literal>Permission</literal> for use between

        <indexterm><primary>Operation</primary></indexterm>
        <para>An operation is a service that can be requested from an 
        object to effect behavior. In the UML metamodel it is a 
        sub-class of <literal>BehavioralFeature</literal> which is 
        itself a sub-class of <literal>Feature</literal>.</para>

        <para>In the diagram, an operation is represented on a single 
        line within the operation compartment of the class. Its syntax 
        is as follows:</para>

        <blockquote>

          <para>visibility name (parameter list) : 
          return-type-expression {property-string}</para>

        </blockquote>

        <para>You can edit this line directly in the diagram, by 
        double-clicking on it. All elements are optional and, if left 
        unspecified, the old values will be preserved.</para>

        <para>A <emphasis>stereotype</emphasis> can be given between 
        any two elements in the line in the format: <literal>
        &lt;&lt;stereotype&gt;&gt;</literal>.</para>

        <para>The following properties are recognized to have special 
        meaning: abstract, concurrency, concurrent, guarded, leaf, 
        query, root and sequential.</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>visibility</emphasis> is <literal>
        +</literal>, <literal>#</literal>, <literal>-</literal> or
        <literal>~</literal> 
        corresponding to <literal>public</literal>, <literal>
        protected</literal>, <literal>private</literal> visibility,
        or <literal>package</literal> visibility 
        respectively.</para>

        <para><literal>static</literal> and <literal>final</literal> 
        optionally appear if the operation has those modifiers. Any 
        operation declared static will have its whole entry underlined 
        on the diagram.</para>

        <para>There may be zero or more entries in the 
        <emphasis>parameter list</emphasis> separated by commas. Every 
        entry is a pair of the form:</para>

        <blockquote>

          <para><emphasis>name</emphasis> <literal>:</literal> 
          <emphasis>type</emphasis></para>

        </blockquote>

        <para>The <emphasis>return-type-expression</emphasis> is the 
        type (UML datatype, class or interface) of the result 
        returned.</para>

        <para>Finally the whole entry is shown in italics if the 
        operation is declared abstract.</para>

        <para>An association on a class diagram represents a 
        relationship between classes, or between a class and an 
        interface. On a usecase diagram, an association binds an actor 
        to a usecase.</para>

        <para>Within the UML metamodel, <literal>Association</literal> 
        is a sub-class of both <literal>Relationship</literal> and 
        <literal>GeneralizableElement</literal>.</para>

        <para>The association is represented as a solid line connecting 
        actor and usecase or class or interface (see 
        <xref linkend="fig.ref.class_diagram"/>). The name of the 
        association and any stereotype appear above the line.</para>

        <para>ArgoUML is not restricted to binary associations. See 
        <xref linkend="s2.ref.association_multiway"/> for more on 
        this.</para>

        <para>Associations are permitted between interfaces and 
        classes, but UML 1.3 specifies they must only be navigable 
        toward the interface—in other words the interface cannot see 
        the class. ArgoUML will draw such associations with the 
        appropriate navigation.</para>

        <para>Associations are often not named, when their meaning is 
        obvious from the context.</para>

        <note>

          <para>ArgoUML provides no specific way of showing the 
          direction of the association as described in the UML 1.4 
          standard. The naming should attempt to make this clear.</para>

        </note>

        <para>The association contains at least two ends, which may be 
        navigated to via the association property sheet. See 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.association_end_class"/> for more 
        information.</para>

          <para>UML 1.3 provides for N-ary associations and 
          associations that are governed by a third 
          <emphasis>associative class</emphasis>. Both are supported by 
          ArgoUML.</para>

          <para><emphasis>N-ary associations</emphasis> are created by 
          drawing with the association tool from an existing 
          association to a third class. The current implementation of 
          ArgoUML does not allow the inverse: drawing from a 3rd class 
          towards an existing association is not possible.</para>

          <para>Association Classes are drawn exactly like a normal 
          association, i.e. between two classes, but with a different 
          dedicated tool from the diagram toolbar.</para>

        of the parent association (see 
        <xref linkend="fig.ref.use_case_diagram"/>). Where shared or

        <tip>

          <para>Although you can change attributes of association ends 
          when creating a use case model, this is often not necessary. 
          Many of the properties of an association end relate to its 
          use in class diagrams, and are of limited relevance to use 
          cases. The most useful attributes to consider altering are 
          the name (used as the role name) and the multiplicity.</para>

                      <para>The UML 1.4 standard provides a number of

                      means that arrow heads are shown at the end of an 
                      association, when navigation is enabled at only 
                      one end, to indicate the direction in which 
                      navigation is possible. This means that the

        <para>An interface is a set of operations characterizing the

        abstract class with no attributes and no non-abstract

        <para>An interface is represented on a class diagram as a 
        rectangle with two horizontal compartments. The top compartment 
        displays the interface name (and above it <literal>
        «interface»</literal>) and the second any operations. Just like 
        a class, the operations compartment can be hidden.</para>

        <para>An abstraction is a dependency relationship joining two

        dependencies, which link artifacts that 
        <emphasis>specify</emphasis> behavior to the corresponding

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created 
        within a sequence diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of 
        artifacts on the diagram may not actually themselves appear on 
        the diagram.</para>

        <para>There is a close relationship between this material and 
        the <literal>Properties</literal> tab of the details pane (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers 
        properties in general, in this chapter they are linked to 
        specific artifacts.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>Sequence diagrams are not fully developed yet in 
          ArgoUML. Many aspects are not fully implemented, or may not 
          behave as expected.</para>

          <title>Limitations Concerning Sequence Diagrams in 
          ArgoUML</title>

          <para>The sequence diagram is still rather under-developed in 
          ArgoUML.</para>

          <para>The biggest difficulties are with the actions behind 
          the stimuli. These are purely textual in implementation, and 
          there is no way to link them back to their associated 
          operations or signals.</para>

      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="s1.ref.object_sequence">

        <title>Object</title>

        <para>An object is an instance of a class. In the UML metamodel 
        <literal>Object</literal> is a sub-class of <literal>
        Instance</literal>. Within a sequence diagram objects may be 
        used to represent a specific instance of a class. Unlike 
        collaboration diagrams (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.entcollab"/>
        ), sequence diagrams cannot show generic behavior between 
        classifier roles.</para>

        <para>An object is represented on a sequence diagram in ArgoUML 
        as a plain box labeled with the object name (if any) and class 
        name, separated by a colon (:). As links with stimuli to and 
        from other objects are added, a time line grows down from the 
        object. This is thin where the object does not have control and 
        thick where it does.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>The current release of ArgoUML shows interactions 
          between objects, although the UML standard for sequence 
          diagrams is for interaction between instances of any 
          classifier).</para>

          <para>However the actual implementation in ArgoUML permits 
          any classifier to be used with the object, and so the diagram 
          can successfully represent instances of actors for example as 
          well as classes.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>In the current release of ArgoUML there is no way to 
          show a terminate action where an object instance destroys 
          itself. One way is to draw a destroy action that loops back 
          to the object itself, give it an action with no name and use 
          the style tab to set an invisible line, but this still leaves 
          the arrow head showing, which is unsightly. It is also 
          semantically incorrect anyway to use a destroy action to 
          represent a terminate action.</para>

          <para>The statechart diagrams support the 7 action types 
          defined (CallAtion, CreateAction, DestroyAction,
          ReturnAction, SendAction,

          but there is no way to use the same action 
          more than once.
          Also, in a few cases, it is not possible to 
          set or select the related elements; 
          e.g.there is no way to select a signal for a SendAction.

        <para>An action specifies an executable statement and is an 
        abstraction of a computational procedure that can change the 
        state of the model. In the UML metamodel it is a child of 
        <literal>ModelElement</literal>. Since in the metamodel an 
        ActionSequence is itself an Action that is an aggregation of 
        other actions (i.e. the &quot;composite&quot; pattern), an 
        ActionSequence may be used anywhere an action may be.</para>

                  the operation generating the action with any 
                  arguments in parentheses and that send actions are 
                  shown as the name of the signal generating the action 
                  with any arguments in parentheses. Return actions 
                  should be shown as the expression for the value they 
                  return, or empty otherwise. Create and destroy 
                  actions should shown as <literal>
                  create(&lt;target&gt;)</literal> and <literal>

        <title>Composite State</title>

        <para>A composite state is a state that contains other states 
        (known as sub-states), allowing hierarchical state machines to 
        be constructed.</para>

        <para>A composite state is represented on a statechart diagram 
        in ArgoUML as a large rectangle with rounded corners, with a 
        horizontal line separating the name at the top from the 
        description of the behavior and the model of the sub-state 
        machine below. The description of the behavior includes the 
        entry, exit and do actions and any internal transitions.</para>

        <para>Sub-states are placed within a composite machine by 
        placing them entirely within the composite state. This can be 
        done at creation time, i.e. when creating the state for the 
        first time in the editing pane. Alternatively, an existing 
        state can be dragged onto a composite state.</para>

        <para>The description of a composite state is almost identical 
        to that of a state (see <xref linkend="s1.ref.state"/> and so 
        is not duplicated here. The only differences is one additional

        <para>A submachine state is a syntactical convenience that 
        facilitates reuse and modularity. It is a shorthand that 
        implies a macro-like expansion by another state machine and is 
        semantically equivalent to a composite state. The state machine 
        that is inserted is called the referenced state machine while 
        the state machine that contains the submachine state is called 
        the containing state machine. The same state machine may be 
        referenced more than once in the context of a single containing 
        state machine. In effect, a submachine state represents a 
        <emphasis>call</emphasis> to a state machine 
        <emphasis>subroutine</emphasis> with one or more entry 
        and exit points. The entry and exit points are specified by

        <title>Pseudostate</title>

        <para>A pseudostate encompasses a number of different transient 
        vertices on a state machine diagram. They are used, typically, 
        to connect multiple transitions into more complex state 
        transitions paths. For example, by combining a transition 
        entering a fork pseudostate with a set of transitions exiting 
        the fork pseudostate, we get a compound transition that leads 
        to a set of concurrent target states. Pseudostates do not have 
        the properties of a full state and serve only as a connection 
        point for transactions (but with some semantic value). Within 
        the UML metamodel, <literal>Pseudostate</literal> is a 
        sub-class of <literal>StateVertex</literal>.</para>

        <para>The representation of a pseudostate on a statechart 
        diagram in ArgoUML depends on the particular kind of 
        pseudostate: initial, deepHistory, shallowHistory, join, fork, 
        junction and choice. ArgoUML lets you place any pseudostate 
        directly by tools for the specific types of pseudostate. These 
        are described in separate sections below (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.initial_state"/>, 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.junction_state"/>,

        <title>Synch State</title>

        <para>A synch state is for synchronizing concurrent regions of 
        a state machine. It is used in conjunction with forks and joins 
        to insure that one region leaves a particular state or states 
        before another region can enter a particular state or states. 
        The firing of outgoing transitions from a synch state can be 
        limited by specifying a bound on the difference between the 
        number of times outgoing and incoming transitions have fired. 
        In the UML metamodel <literal>Synch</literal> is a child of 
        <literal>StateVertex</literal>.</para>

        <para>A synch state is shown as a small circle with the upper 
        bound inside it. The bound is either a positive integer or a 
        star (&apos;*&apos;) for unlimited. Synch states are drawn on 
        the boundary between two regions when possible.</para>

      <title>Collaboration Diagram Artifact Reference</title>

      <sect1>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created 
        within a collaboration diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of 
        artifacts on the diagram may not actually themselves appear on 
        the diagram.</para>

        <para>There is a close relationship between this material and 
        the properties tab of the details pane (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers 
        Properties in general, in this chapter they are linked to 
        specific artifacts.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>Collaboration diagrams are not fully developed yet in 
          ArgoUML. Many aspects are not fully implemented, or may not 
          behave as expected. In particular there are some serious 
          problems with layout of the collaboration roles and 
          messages.</para>

          <title>Limitations Concerning Collaboration Diagrams in 
          ArgoUML</title>

          <para>The collaboration diagram is still rather 
          under-developed in ArgoUML. In particular there is no way to 
          show instance collaborations (based on objects and links) 
          rather than specification collaborations.</para>

          <para>The biggest difficulties are with the messages. There 
          are problems with the sequencing of the messages and their 
          display on the diagram. The actions behind them are purely 
          textual in implementation and there is no way to link them 
          back to their associated operations or signals.</para>

        <title>Classifier Role</title>

        <para>A classifier role is a specialization of a classifier, 
        used to show its behavior in a particular context. In the UML 
        metamodel <literal>Classifier Role</literal> is a sub-class of 
        <literal>Classifier</literal>. Within a collaboration diagram 
        classifier roles may be used in one of two ways:</para>

        <itemizedlist>

          <listitem>

            <para>To represent the classifier in a particular 
            behavioral context (the <emphasis>specification 
            level</emphasis>); or</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>

            <para>to specify a particular instance of the classifier 
            (the <emphasis>instance level</emphasis>).</para>

          </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>In this latter form, classifier roles are identical to 
        the instances used in sequence diagrams (see 
        <xref linkend="ch.ref.entseq"/>) and a collaboration diagram 
        shows the same information as the sequence diagram, but in a 
        different presentation.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>A collaboration diagram should not mix classifier roles 
          used as the specifier level and the instance level.</para>

        </caution>

        <para>A classifier role is represented on a sequence diagram in 
        ArgoUML as a plain box labeled with the classifier role name 
        (if any) and classifier, separated by a colon (:).</para>

        <caution>

          <para>A classifier role should properly also show object name 
          (if any) preceding the classifier role name and separated 
          from it by a slash (<literal>/</literal>). This allows 
          classifier roles in a specification level diagram to be 
          distinguished from instances in an instance level 
          diagram.</para>

          <para>ArgoUML does show the slash, but there is no way to 
          define the instances.</para>

        <title>Association Role</title>

        <para>An association role is a specialization of an 
        association, used to describe an associations behavior in a 
        particular context. In the UML metamodel <literal>Association 
        Role</literal> is a sub-class of <literal>
        Association</literal>.</para>

        <para>An association role is represented on a collaboration 
        diagram in ArgoUML as a line connecting the instances 
        concerned. However on a sequence diagram the representation is 
        modified to reflect the type of action associated with the 
        stimulus carried on the link (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.stimulus"/>).</para>

        <para>The association role is labeled with the association role 
        name (if any).</para>

        <para>

          An association role shows its name and the association name 
          according the following syntax:
          <blockquote>

            <para>/ AssociationRoleName : AssociationName</para>

          </blockquote>

          in the same manner as a classifier role. The more generic 
          syntax is:
          <blockquote>

            <para>I / R : C</para>

          </blockquote>

          which stands for an Instance named I originating from the 
          Classifier C playing the role R.

        <title>Association End Role</title>

        <para>An association end role is a specialization of an 
        association end, used to describe an association end&apos;s 
        behavior in a particular context. In the UML metamodel <literal>
        AssociationEndRole</literal> is a sub-class of <literal>
        AssociationEnd</literal>.</para>

        <para>Two or more association end roles are associated with 
        each association role (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.association_role"/>), although for 
        ArgoUML, the number of ends can only be two.</para>

        <para>The association end role has no direct access on any 
        diagram, although its stereotype, name and multiplicity is 
        shown at the relevant end of the parent association role (see 
        <xref linkend="fig.ref.collaboration_diagram"/>), and some of 
        its properties can be directly adjusted with button 2 click. 
        Where shared or composite aggregation is selected for one 
        association end role, the opposite end is shown as a solid 
        diamond (composite aggregation) or hollow diamond (shared 
        aggregation).</para>

        <note>

          <para>ArgoUML does not currently (V0.18) support showing 
          qualifiers on the diagram, as described in the UML 1.4 
          standard.</para>

        </note>

        <caution>

          <para>An association end role should have the same, or 
          <quote>stricter</quote> attribute values than its base 
          association end. In particular its navigability should be no 
          more general. There is as yet no critic in ArgoUML to offer 
          advice on this rule.</para>

        <title>Message</title>

        <para>A message is a communication between two instances of an 
        association role on a specification level collaboration 
        diagram. It describes an action which will generate the 
        stimulus associated with the message. On a collaboration 
        diagram a message is associated with an association role. In 
        the UML metamodel <literal>Message</literal> is a sub-class of 
        <literal>ModelElement</literal>.</para>

        <para>The message is represented on a collaboration diagram in 
        ArgoUML by its sequence number separated by a colon from the 
        expression defining the associated action. It is accompagnied 
        by an arrow pointing in the direction of the communication, 
        i.e. the direction of the AssociationRole. By convention the 
        name of a message is not shown on the diagram. Instead the 
        diagram displays the message sequence number, either as an 
        integer or as a decimal number to show hierarchy.</para>

        <warning>

          <para>The current release of ArgoUML does not retaining 
          message positioning after reloading the project, i.e. as if 
          the positions were not stored in the project file.</para>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created 
        within an Activity diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of 
        artifacts may not actually themselves appear on the 
        diagram.</para>

        <para>There is a close relationship between this material and 
        the Properties Tab of the Details Pane (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers 
        Properties in general, in this chapter they are linked to 
        specific artifacts.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="fig.ref.activity_diagram"/> shows an 
        Activity Diagram with all possible artifacts displayed.</para>

          <title>Limitations Concerning Activity Diagrams in 
          ArgoUML</title>

          <para>Activity diagrams are not fully developed yet in 
          ArgoUML. Some aspects are not fully implemented, or may not 
          behave as expected. In particular lacking are call states, 
          swim lanes, control icons (signals), sub-activities, synch 
          states. Interactions with other classifiers are provided by 
          an object-flow-state which is only partly implemented.</para>

      <sect1>

        <title>Action State</title>

        <para>An action state represents execution of an atomic action, 
        usually the invocation of an action. Within the UML metamodel, 
        <literal>ActionState</literal> is a sub-class of <literal>
        SimpleState</literal>. It is a specialized simple state that 
        only has an entry action, and with an implicit trigger as soon 
        as that action is completed.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>As a consequence any outgoing transitions from an 
          action state should not have explicit triggers defined 
          (ArgoUML will not currently check for this). They may have 
          guards to provide a choice where there is more than one 
          transition.</para>

        </caution>

        <note>

          <para>Unlike an ordinary state, an internal transition, an 
          exit action and a Do activity are not permitted for action 
          states.</para>

        </note>

        <para>An action state is represented on an activity diagram in 
        ArgoUML as a rectangle with rounded corners containing the name 
        of the action state.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>The UML standard specifies that the text shown in the 
          action state on the activity diagram should contain the 
          expression associated with the entry action - which is 
          implemented as such since ArgoUML V0.18. In past versions of 
          ArgoUML (0.16.1 and before), the diagram used to show the 
          action state name. Loading a project created by one of the 
          older versions, causes the project file to be converted to 
          the correct format to conform to the UML standard. This process is 
          designed to be transparent for the user, and the only 
          drawback is, that the activity diagram in the project will 
          not show correctly when reloaded in an old version of ArgoUML 
          again.</para>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created 
        within a Deployment Diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of 
        artifacts on the diagram may not actually themselves appear on 
        the diagram.</para>

        <para>There is a close relationship between this material and 
        the Properties Tab of the Details Pane (see 
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers 
        Properties in general, in this chapter they are linked to 
        specific artifacts.</para>

        <para>Within ArgoUML, the deployment diagram is used for both 
        component diagrams (i.e. without instances, showing static 
        dependencies of components) and deployment diagrams (showing 
        how instances of components are handled by instances of nodes 
        at run-time).</para>

        <caution>

          <para>Deployment diagrams are not fully developed yet in 
          ArgoUML. Some aspects are not fully implemented or may not

          <title>Limitations Concerning Deployment Diagrams in 
          ArgoUML</title>

          <para>The deployment diagram is generally well drawn, but 
          there are only a subset of the relationships that should be 
          shown available, which restricts the ability to show dynamic 
          behavior of deployed code.</para>

          <para>It is not possible to create new interfaces directly on 
          this diagram; they can only be added if they are first 
          created in the model (by drawing them on a class 
          diagram).</para>

          <para>It is an inconvenience that the alternative 
          representation of an interface (as a small circle) is not 
          supported.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>UML relies on stereotyping of dependencies on component 
          and deployment diagrams to characterize the types of 
          relationship. In the current release of ArgoUML there are

        <caution>

          <para>The V0.18 release of ArgoUML uses the same 
          representation of an interface as a class diagram. The UML

          circle, connected to the component which realizes that 
          interface.</para>

        <warning>

          <para>There is no way to show the linking of an interface to

          &quot;Type&quot; combo-box on the property sheet of a 
          parameter of an operation of a class), then it becomes 
          visible: you will find that the DataType, Class, or Interface 
          has appeared in the model, in its correct package stucture 
          for the latter 2.</para>

        <title>Built In Stereotypes</title>

        <para>UML 1.4 defines a large number of stereotypes 
        of which most are 
        supported by ArgoUML.</para>

        <caution>

          <para>Not all stereotypes defined by UML 1.4 appear in 
          ArgoUML V0.20 due to 
          the fact that they were not yet updated 
          from previous versions of ArgoUML 
          that only supported UML 1.3.
          Also, there are
          limitations in the current implementation of 
          some base elements. The table below lists all stereotypes defined 
          in UML 1.4 and if they are supported in 
          ArgoUML or not.</para>

        </caution>

        <caution>

          <para>The UML 1.4 standard also specifies many stereotypes in 
          the chapters <quote>Example Profiles</quote>: one for 
          <quote>Software Development</quote> and one for 
          <quote>Business Modeling</quote>. Due to the specialized 
          nature of these profiles, implementation in ArgoUML is 
          postponed until a yet undetermined moment.</para>

    <title>The C++ Module</title>

    <para>The ArgoUML C++ Module (C++ Mod.) provides C++ code 
    generation functionalities and C++ notation within ArgoUML. It 
    works the same way as the other languages&apos; modules.</para>

    <sect1>

      <title>Modeling for C++</title>

      <para>The C++ programming language has constructs that 
      aren&apos;t contained by default in UML. Examples are pointers, 
      global functions and variables, references and operator 
      overloading. To enable us to apply these constructs in our models 
      and be capable of taking advantage of it for code generation and 
      C++ notation in UML diagrams, the C++ module uses conventions in 
      the use of the extension features of UML, tagged values and 
      stereotypes.</para>

      <para>Since UML and C++ are object oriented, there is an obvious 
      correspondence between the UML model elements and C++ structural 
      constructs, e.g, the UML <literal>Class</literal> is related to 
      the C++ <literal>class</literal>. These obvious relations will 
      not be described here, since it is assumed that an ArgoUML user 
      that wants to model for C++ has basic knowledge of both C++ and 
      UML.</para>

      <para>Tagged values are one of the main means by which we can 
      define code generation behavior. They have a name – the tag – and 
      a value, and are applied to model elements.</para>

      <para>The tagged values in use for the C++ module have two 
      categories:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>

          <para>free format values – any <literal>String</literal> is 
          valid, except the empty <literal>String</literal></para>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>formated values – the value must obey some 
          restrictions, e.g., be one of <literal>true</literal> or 
          <literal>false</literal> (abbreviated to <literal>true || 
          false</literal>)</para>

        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For <literal>Boolean</literal> tagged values, only the 
      values &quot;<literal>true</literal>&quot; or &quot;
      <literal>false</literal>&quot; are applicable. If a <literal>
      Boolean</literal> tagged value does not exist or is invalid for 
      one model element, a default value is assumed by the code 
      generator. In the bellow documentation the default value is 
      marked.</para>

      <para>Free format tagged values are only significant if present 
      and if the value isn&apos;t an empty <literal>String</literal>. 
      When the value must follow some sort of format, that is 
      explicitly stated. In this case, there is the chance that the 
      value is invalid. If the value is invalid, no assumptions are 
      made; the generator will trace the problem and ignore the tagged 
      value.</para>

                this way, just use multiple tagged values with <literal>
                header_incl</literal> as the tag.</para>

                <para>Other tagged values used for C++ modeling may 
                also be used this way. This note won&apos;t be repeated

        the curly braces are placed within the preserved area, 
        attribute initializers are preserved on constructors.</para>

        <para>This also works if you change Method Names after the

    <title>The CRC Card Methodology</title>

    <para>
      A CRC card is ostensibly an index card that is used to represent
      classes, their responsibilities, and the interactions between them.
      The term CRC card is also used to refer to a methodology for object
      oriented modeling based on their use.
    </para>

    <para>
      Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham introduced CRC cards in a paper
      "A Laboratory for Teaching Object-Oriented Thinking" that was presented at
      the OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages &amp; Applications)
      conference in 1989.
      A tutorial on the subject can be found at
      <ulink url="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dbutler/tutorials/winter96/crc_b/"/>.
      The CRC card methodology was originally designed as a teaching tool but
      has proved useful as a modeling tool as well.
    </para>

    <para>
      The three parts of the CRC acronym were felt by the authors of the
      paper to represent the essential dimensions of object oriented modeling.
      The term Responsibilities refers to the contract that the class
      under discussion offers to the rest of the world (Interface and
      Contract are similar concepts).
      Responsibilities model the things that a class can do.
      Services, Methods, or Operations will result from these.
      The term Collaborators refers to the classes whose services
      the class under discussion will use.
      Kent Beck tried unsuccessfully to use ther term Helpers instead of
      Collaborators to indicate classes that were supporting the class under
      discussion.
      It is widely believed that the terminology was chosen because CRC are
      the initials of Ward Cunningham's son.
    </para>

    <para>
      Why use CRC cards?
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
          They are portable.
          No computers are required so they can be used anywhere.
          Even away from the office.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          They allow the participants to experience first hand
          how the system will work.
          No computer tool can replace the interaction that happens by
          physically picking up the cards and playing the role of that object.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          They are a useful tool for teaching people the object-oriented
          paradigm.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          They can be used as a methodology themselves or as a front end to a
          more formal methodology such as Booch, Wirfs-Brock, Jacobson, etc.
          Although CRC cards were created for teaching, they have proven
          useful for much more.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          They have become an accepted method for analysis and design.
          The biggest contributing factor to their success is the fact that they
          provide an informal and non threatening environment that is
          productive to working and learning.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <sect1>

      <title>The Card</title>

      <para>
        The exact format of the card can be customized to the preferences of
        the group, but the minimal required information is the name of the
        class, it's subclasses and superclasses, it's responsibilities
        and the collaborators for each of those responsibilities.
        The back of the card can be used for a description of the class.
        During the design phase attributes of the class can be recorded on
        the back as well.
        One way to think of the card is that the front contains
        the public information, and the back contains the encapsulated,
        implementation details.
        As a class is defined a card is made for that class with
        its name entered.
        When a class is assigned to an individual that has only a class name
        on it, the individual (or the group) selects an initial set of
        responsibilities for the class.
        This initial set should be whatever (if anything) is
        immediately obvious.
      </para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>The Group</title>

      <para>
        Whether they are implicitly or explicitly defined the requirements
        for the system need to be familiar to the people participating
        in the group.
      </para>

      <para>
        The ideal group size for a CRC card session is five or six people.
        This size generally allows everyone to productively participate.
        In groups of larger size productivity is cut by more disagreements and
        the amount of participation by each is lower.
        If there are more than six people, one solution is to have the extra
        people be present strictly as observers.
      </para>

      <para>
        The group five or six people in the core group should be composed of
        developers, domain experts, and an object-oriented
        technology facilitator.
      </para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>The Session</title>

      <para>
        Before starting a session a part of the problem needs to be selected
        for the session to focus on.
        Essentially, this means picking the set of classes that are
        to be used.
      </para>

      <para>
        Pick the scenarios that are to be walked through that use the classes
        picked above.
        Start with scenarios that are part of the systems normal operation
        first, and then exceptional scenarios, like error recover, later.
      </para>

      <para>
        Assign each class to a member of the group.
        Each person should be responsible for at least one class.
        They are the owner of that class for the session.
        Each person records the name of their class on a card.
        One class per card.
      </para>

      <para>
        Walk-throughs are the heart of the CRC card session.
        To walk through a scenario address each action in it one at a time.
        First decide which class is responsible for this function.
        The owner of the class then picks up his card and
        holds it up in the air.
        When a card is up in the air it is an object and can do things.
        The owner announces that he needs to fulfill his responsibility.
        The responsibility is refined into smaller tasks if possible.
        These smaller tasks can be fulfilled by the object is appropriate or
        they can be fulfilled by interacting with other objects
        (collaborators).
        If no other appropriate class exists, you may need to make one
        and assign it to someone.
        This is the fundamental procedure of the scenario execution.

      <title>The Process</title>


      <para>
        CRC Cards are used in the Analysis and Design phases.
        The process for these phases differ primarily in how the classes
        and scenarios are chosen.
      </para>

      <para>
        In the Analysis phase the classes and scenarios are in the problem
        space and generally derive from the requirements.
        In the Design phase solution space classes and scenarios are added.
        Additionally in the Analysis phase the very first session starts with
        no classes or scenarios to select from so a special session creates
        them.
