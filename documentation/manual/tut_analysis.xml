  <title>Analysis</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Analysis is the process of taking the <quote>customer</quote>
      requirements and re-casting them in the language of, and from the
      perspective of, a putative solution.</para>

    <para>We are not actually trying the flesh out the detailed solution at
      this stage. That occurs in the <emphasis>Design Phase</emphasis> (see
      <xref linkend="ch.tut.design"/>).</para>

    <para>Unlike the boundary between Requirements and Analysis Phases, the
      boundary between Analysis and Design Phases is inherently blurred. The
      key is that analysis should define the solution no further than is
      necessary to specify the requirements in the language of the
      solution. The artifacts in Analysis generally represent a high level of
      abstraction.</para>

    <para>Once again the <emphasis>recursive</emphasis>, and
      <emphasis>iterative</emphasis> nature of our process means we will come
      back to the Analysis phase many times in the future.</para>
