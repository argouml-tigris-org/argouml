<chapter id="ch.ref.menu">
  <title>The Menu bar</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>An important principle behind &argouml; is that actions should be
      able to be invoked in whatever way the user finds convenient. As a result
      many (but not all) actions that can be carried out on the menu can be
      carried out in other ways as well under &argouml;.</para>

    <para>A number of the common menu entries are also available through
      keyboard shortcuts.</para>

    <para>It is also be possible to navigate the menu from the
      keyboard. Each level of each menu is identified by a letter
      (shown underlined in the menu or entry name 
      from the moment the ALT key is pressed). 
      This sequence of letters while holding down the ALT key selects the entry. 
      In the version V0.14 of &argouml; this functionality is only available when running
      under Microsoft Windows.
<!-- TODO: confirm that on other than MSWindows this functionality is absent -->
      </para>

    <para>
The following is an explanation of why the menuitems are grouped as they are.
    </para>

    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>File</emphasis> menu contains operations that affect on the whole project/file. 
All the items in this menu can be explained as such.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Edit</emphasis> menu is generally intended for editing the model or changing the content of a diagram. 
It also contains functions to enable editing, like e.g. selecting. 
This menu is not intended for diagram layout functions. 
Most functions here do something with the selected modelelement and diagram. 
The item "Settings..." is an exception here, logically it might belong better under
the File menu, but people are used to find it here.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>View</emphasis> menu is for functions that do never alter the model, 
nor the diagram layout, only the way you view the diagram. 
Good examples are "zoom" and "notation".  
Also navigational functions belong here, e.g. "Find" and "Goto Diagram...". 
All changes of settings in this menu apply to all diagrams (e.g. zoom).
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Create</emphasis> menu contains all possible diagrams that can be
created. 
Downlighting is context dependend, since these functions work on the selected modelelement.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Arrange</emphasis> menu is only for layout changes in a diagram, which is not the same as the items in the View menu. 
Functions here can not alter the UML model.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Generation</emphasis> menu is for Code Generation. 
The functions here work either on the selected modelelements, or on the whole project.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Critique</emphasis> menu is specific for this function, 
it contains settings for the project.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Tools</emphasis> menu currently contains the "Export as XMI" item. 
Also, if plugins are installed, then their functions appear here.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
The <emphasis>Help</emphasis> menu contains the usual "information" and "about".
        </para></listitem>

      </indexterm>
      <para>Shortcut Ctrl-N.</para>

      <para>This initializes a new project within &argouml;. The project is
        created without a the name. It contains a (top-level) 
        <literal>Model</literal> named <literal>untitledModel</literal> 
        and two empty diagrams: 
        a class diagram and a use case diagram.</para>

      <caution><para><literal>untitledModel</literal> is not a conventional
        model name (most processes suggest models should start with an upper
        case letter). &argouml; permits you to use a lower case letter, but
<!-- TODO: The critic suggests to use lowercase only! 
So, who is right? - the critic, or the description here? -->
        a critic will trigger to warn that this is not conventional. See <xref
        linkend="s1.ref.model"/> for a discussion of this.</para></caution>
        
      <para>
        If the model has been altered
        (as indicated by the "*" in the titlebar of &argouml;'s window), 
        then activating the "New" function is
        potentionally not the user's intention, since it will erase the changes.
        Hence a confirmation dialog appears to allow the user to save his work
        first, or cancel the operation completely.

      <para>This opens an existing project from a file.

      </figure>

      <para>At the top of the dialog is a drop down selector labeled
        <literal>Look&nbsp;in:</literal>, specifying the currently selected
        directory preceded by the folder icon,
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/folder.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>. The drop down selector
        gives access to all directories above this directory.</para>

      <para>Next to this are four icons:
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/up_directory.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> to move up a directory;

          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/home.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> to select the users home
        directory,

          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/list_files.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> to specify that a simple

        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> 
        that shows details of all files.</para>

      <para>The main body of the dialog is a text area with a listing of all
        directories and
        files in the currently selected directory which match the current
        filter (see below). If these will not all fit on the display,
        scroll bars are provided to browse through the list.</para>
      
      <para>Hence, navigating up a directory tree is possible by selecting 
        a directory in the drop down selector at the top of this dialog.
        Navigating deeper in the tree happens by double clicking &button1; on
        the directory shown in the main text area.
      </para>

      <para>In the lower portion of the dialog is a text box labeled
        <literal>File&nbsp;name:</literal> for the name of the file to be
        opened. The file name may be typed directly in here, or selected from
        the directory listing above using &button1; click.</para>

      <para>Beneath this is a drop down selector labeled
        <literal>Files&nbsp;of&nbsp;type:</literal> to specify a filter on the
        files to be shown in the directory listing. Only files that match the
        filter are listed. The available filters are listed below. 
        The default filter is the second one (.zargo).</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Argo uncompressed project files (*.argo) 
        were produced by earlier releases of &argouml;.
        XMI files allow you to use diagrams from other tools 
        (which may not
        alweays work, 
        since &argouml; is only compatible with XMI for UML 1.3).
      </para>

      <para>To the right of the file name and filter are two buttons,
        <literal>Open</literal> and <literal>Cancel</literal> to open the
        selected project or cancel the operation.</para>

      <para>This opens a dialog allowing you to save the project under a

This menu-item allows you to throw away all your recent changes,

It works a bit like an <literal>Undo</literal> feature, 
but only restores changes done since the last time the file was saved.

      <para>
When this menu-item is activated, 
a small confirmation dialog box opens, 
as shown in the figure below.
This warning that all recent changes will be discarded, 
is needed because the action can not be undone.
Selecting <literal>No</literal> cancels the whole action as if you did not select the menu-item in the first place.
Selecting <literal>Yes</literal> reloads the last saved file.

            </indexterm>
              Selects all artifacts on the current pane or in the current field. 
              The exact behaviour depends on the <literal>current
              pane</literal>: explorer pane, editing pane, to-do pane, details
              pane. One rule applies in all cases though: the selection on the
              diagram (editing pane) and in the explorer are always
              synchronised.
          </para>
          <para> If the editing pane is the <literal>current pane</literal>:
            First everything in the explorer and 
            on the current diagram is deselected,
            and then everything that is on the current diagram is selected 
            (on both panes, because they are always synchronised).
          </para>
          <para>
            If the explorer pane is the <literal>current pane</literal>: 
            All visible items in the explorer pane
            are selected, and non-visible items are deselected.
          </para>
          <para>
            If the to-do pane is the <literal>current pane</literal>:
            All visible items in the to-do pane
            are selected, and non-visible items are deselected.
            in fact, this works the same as for the explorer pane, because both
            are tree structures.

          <para>
            If the details pane is the <literal>current pane</literal>:
            The function only works in certain fields, where selecting is
            possible, e.g. a Name field. In such a case, the Select All function
            extends the current selection to the whole field contents.

      <title>Empty trash</title>
      <para>This menu function has no discernible effect yet. 
        In the future this will be a trash can icon in the project
        browser.  Deleting an object moves it to the trash.  You can move
        things back out of the trash if you like.  Eventually you empty the
        trash.  Critics check for relationships between things that will
        break when the trash is empty.  E.g., Class X's superclass is in
        the trash, you must fix this before you empty the trash."</para>

    <title>The Critique Menu</title>

    <para>This menu controls one of &argouml;'s unique features&mdash;the use
      of critics to guide the designer. The theory behind this is well
      described in Jason Robbins' PhD dissertation <ulink
      url="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/">
      http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</ulink>.</para>

    <note><para>A word about terminology: The <emphasis>critics</emphasis> are
      background processes, which evaluate the current model according to
      various <quote>good</quote> design criteria. There is one critic for
      every design criterion.</para>

    <para>The output of a critic is a <emphasis>critique</emphasis>&mdash;a
      statement about some aspect of the model that does not appear to follow
      good design practice.</para>

    <para>Finally a critique will generally suggest how the bad design issue it
      has identified can be rectified, by raising a
      <emphasis>to-do item</emphasis>.</para></note>

    <note><para>The critics run as asynchronous processes in parallel

      Rationale: 
      1. The word "Toggle" is not needed, because you can see from the
      checkbox that this is a toggle item.
      2. The user needs only know the word "critics", not "critique". This

      <para>This is a check box, controlling whether the critics are

      <para>To the right of the list are a series of fields, 
        titled <literal>Critic Details</literal>, giving detailed
        control over individual critics. Selecting a critic in the list on the
        left will populate the fields for that critic.</para>

      <para>The first field on the right is titled <literal>Critic Class:</literal>
        and then the full name of the class in &argouml; that implements the
        critic. The last part of this name (after the last dot) can be used 
        as unique identifier of the critique, 
        e.g. in conversations about the critic.
      </para>

      <para>The first field below this title is a text box labeled
        <literal>Headline:</literal> giving the complete headline of the critic
        (which may be truncated in the list on the left).</para>
<!-- TODO: Widening the dialog box only widens the left part, hence the long
names still are not readable in this field. Should be 50% division at all time. 
See issue ... -->

      <note><para>In the headline you may see the text
        <literal>&lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be replaced
        by the name of the artifact in question when the critic is
        triggered.</para></note>

      <para>The next field is a drop-down selector, labeled
        <literal>Priority:</literal>. The three options available are
        <literal>High</literal>, <literal>Medium</literal> and
        <literal>Low</literal> and specify the priority category of any to-do
        item generated by this critic.
        <!-- TODO: Does it alter the already existing ones? -->
      </para>

      <para>The next field is labeled <literal>MoreInfo:</literal> and
        contains a URL pointing to further information with a button to the
        right labeled <literal>Go</literal> to navigate to that URL.</para>

      <warning><para>In the V0.14 release of &argouml; there is no further
        information available, 
        <!-- TODO: See issue ... --> 
        and the <literal>Go</literal> button is always
        grayed out and disabled.
        <!-- TODO: See issue ... -->
      </para></warning>

      <para>The next field is labeled <literal>Description:</literal> and is a
        text area with a detailed explanation of what this critic means. If the
        text is too large for the area a scroll bar is provided to the
        right.</para>

      <note><para>In this text area you may see the text
        <literal>&lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be replaced
        by the name of the artifact in question when the critic is
        triggered.</para></note>

      <para>The last field is a drop-down selector labeled
        <literal>Use&nbsp;Clarifier</literal>, with three options,
        <literal>Always</literal>, <literal>If&nbsp;Only&nbsp;One</literal> and
        <literal>Never</literal>.</para>

      <para>Clarifiers are the icons and wavy red underlines drawn on the
actual diagrams to indicate the artefact to which the critic refers.
The original
        intention was to make the mapping from critics to clarifiers 
        somewhat customizable.</para>

      <para>For example one user might make a <literal>Missing Name</literal>
        critic show a red underline, another user might turn off the clarifier,
        or have it draw a wavy green underline or a blue questionmark.  Critics
        with their clarifier's disabled would still produce feedback that is
        listed in the to-do pane.</para>

      <caution><para>In the V0.14 release of &argouml; this selector has no
        function, beyond printing a message on the console. It is for future
        development.</para></caution>

      <para>Underneath the fields are three buttons in a horizontal row.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><literal>Wake</literal>. It is possible to snooze a
          critic from the to-do pane (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.todopane"/>),
          which makes the critic inactive for a period. If the critic has been
          snoozed, this button is enabled and will wake the critic back up
          again. Otherwise it is grayed out.</para>

        <tip><para>You can tell a snoozed critic, because in the list on the
          left it will be indicated
          in the third column.</para></tip></listitem>

        <listitem><para><literal>Configure</literal>. This button is for
          configuring the critic.</para>

        <caution><para>In the V0.14 version of &argouml; this function is not
          implemented, and this button is always grayed out. It is for future
          development.</para></caution></listitem>

        <listitem><para><literal>Edit Network</literal>. Right now critics are
          implemented in java code. That means end-users cannot add new
          critics.</para>

        <para>The idea of a critic network is that they would be a state
          machine like diagram with several steps. Each step would express a
          condition which, collectively with the other steps associated with
          that critic, articulates the <quote>rule</quote> that the
          critic is providing.  If the rule fires, then remaining steps would
          define the steps of the wizard to help the user fix the
          problem.</para>

        <para>The ideas behind this are discussed in Chapter 4 of Jason Robbins
          PhD disseration (<ulink
          url="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/diss4.html">
          http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/diss4.html</ulink>.
          In particular look at Figure 1-6 in this chapter and the related
          discussion.</para>

        <para>A suggested implementation is that the conditions could be
          written in OCL against the UML meta-model.  A library of predefined
          conditions and steps would allow end-users to build new critics by
          combining those in novel ways.</para>

        <caution><para>In the V0.14 version of &argouml; this function is not
          implemented, and this button is always grayed out. It is for future
          development.</para></caution></listitem>
