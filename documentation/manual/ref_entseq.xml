Description of all the artifacts associated with Sequence Diagrams within

  <caution>
    <para>
In ArgoUML 0.14 the sequence diagrams are not available.
They will be replaced by a new and improved version in the upcoming release.
In the 0.12 release they were not working and in the 0.10 release
that is described here
they did not follow the UML specification correctly.
</para>
    <para>
This chapter is left in the manual for those that might
need it because they are still working with &argouml; 0.10.1.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created within a
      sequence diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of artifacts on the
      diagram may not actually themselves appear on the diagram.</para>

    <para>There is a close relationship between this material and the
      <literal>Properties</literal> tab of the details pane (see
      <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers properties in
      general, in this chapter they are linked to specific artifacts.</para>

    <caution><para>Sequence diagrams are not fully developed yet in
      &argouml;. Many aspects are not fully implemented, or may not behave as
      expected.</para></caution>

      <title>Limitations Concerning Sequence Diagrams in &argouml;</title>

      <para>The sequence diagram is still rather under-developed in
        &argouml;.</para>

      <para>The biggest difficulties are with the actions behind the
        stimuli. These are purely textual in implementation, and there is no
        way to link them back to their associated operations or signals.</para>

  <!-- Artifacts specific to Sequence Diagrams. Object Artifact -->

  <sect1 id="s1.ref.object_sequence">
    <title>Object</title>

    <para>An object is an instance of a class. In the UML metamodel
      <literal>Object</literal> is a sub-class of 
      <literal>Instance</literal>. Within a sequence diagram objects may be
      used to represent a specific instance of a class. Unlike collaboration
      diagrams (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.entcollab"/>), sequence diagrams
      cannot show generic behavior between classifier roles.</para>

    <para>An object is represented on a sequence diagram in &argouml; as a
      plain box labeled with the object name (if any) and class name, separated
      by a colon (:). As links with stimuli to and from other objects are
      added, a time line grows down from the object. This is thin where the
      object does not have control and thick where it does.</para>

    <caution><para>The current release of &argouml; shows interactions between
      objects, although the UML standard for sequence diagrams is for
      interaction between instances of any classifier).</para>

    <para>However the actual implementation in &argouml; permits any classifier
      to be used with the object, and so the diagram can successfully represent
      instances of actors for example as well as classes.</para></caution>

  <!-- Stimulus artifact. This is generic, since the diagram actually allows
       you to add the various graphical stereotypes for different stimuli -->

  <sect1 id="s1.ref.stimulus">
    <title>Stimulus</title>

    <para>A stimulus is a communication between two instances and is generated
      by an action. On a sequence diagram a stimulus is associated with a
      link&mdash;an instance of an association linking two object instances. In
      the UML metamodel <literal>Stimulus</literal> is a sub-class of
      <literal>ModelElement</literal>.</para>

    <para>The link (see <xref linkend="s1.ref.link_sequence"/>) associated with
      a stimulus is represented on a sequence diagram in &argouml; as an arrow
      between the time lines of the object instances (or the object head in the
      case of stimulus create, described below) labeled with the name of the
      action (if any), and the action, separated by a colon (:). The type of
      line and arrowhead depends on the type of action that generated the
      stimulus:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><literal>Stimulus Call</literal>. Generated by a call
        action, itself the result of an operation of a class. Shown as a solid
        line with a solid arrowhead to the time line of the object instance
        receiving the stimulus.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>Stimulus Create</literal>. Generated by a create
        action for the class for which an instance is to be created Shown as a
        solid line with a solid arrowhead to the object head of the object
        instance being created.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>Stimulus Destroy</literal>. Generated by a
        destroy action of the originating object. Shown as a solid line with an
        open arrowhead terminating in a diagonal cross at the end of the
        time line of the receiving (destroyed) object
        instance.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>Stimulus Send</literal>. Generated by a send
        action, the result of a signal raised by an operation of the sending
        object instance and handled by the receiving object instance. Shown as
        a solid line with half an open arrowhead.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>Stimulus Return</literal>. Generated by an
        object instance that has received an earlier call stimulus and is
        returning a result to the calling object instance. Shown as a dotted
        line with an open arrowhead.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note><para>&argouml; does not allow you to create stimuli directly, but
      instead provides tools to create stimuli of each of the five types
      above.</para></note>

    <caution><para>In the current release of &argouml; there is no way to show
      a terminate action where an object instance destroys itself. One way is
      to draw a destroy action that loops back to the object itself, give it an
      action with no name and use the style tab to set an invisible line, but
      this still leaves the arrow head showing, which is unsightly. It is also
      semantically incorrect anyway to use a destroy action to represent a
