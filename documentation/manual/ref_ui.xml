    <title>UML Diagram Types supported by &argouml;</title>

    <para>The UML standard specifies eight principle diagrams, all of which are
      supported by &argouml;.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Use case diagram</emphasis>. Used to capture
        and analyse the requirements for any &ooad; project. See <xref
        linkend="ch.ref.entusecase"/> for details of the &argouml; use case
        diagram and the artifacts it supports.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Class diagram</emphasis>. This diagram captures
        the static structure of the system being designed, showing the classes,
        interfaces and datatypes and how they are related. Variants of this
        diagram are used to show package structures within a system (the
        <emphasis>package diagram</emphasis>) and the relationships between
        particular instances (the <emphasis>object diagram</emphasis>).</para>

      <para>The &argouml; class diagram provides support for class and package
        diagrams. See <xref linkend="ch.ref.entclass"/> for details of the
        artifacts it supports. The current implementation has no support for
        object diagrams.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Behavior diagrams</emphasis>. There are four
        such diagrams (or strictly speaking, five, since the use case diagram
        is a type of behavior diagram), which show the dynamic behavior of the
        system at all levels.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>State diagram</emphasis>. Used to show the
          dynamic behavior of a single object (class instance). This diagram is
          of particular use in systems using complex communication protocols,
          such as in telecommunications. See <xref linkend="ch.ref.entstate"/>
          for details of the &argouml; state diagram and the artifacts it
          supports.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis>Activity diagram</emphasis>. Used to show the
          dynamic behavior of groups of objects (class instance). This diagram
          is an alternative to the state diagram, and is better suited to
          systems with a great deal of user interaction. See <xref
          linkend="ch.ref.entactiv"/> for details of the &argouml; activity
          diagram and the artifacts it supports.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis>Interaction diagrams</emphasis>. There are
          two diagrams in this category, used to show the dynamic interaction
          between objects (class instances) in the system.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Sequence diagram</emphasis>. Shows the
            interactions (typically messages or procedure calls) between
            instances of classes (objects) and actors against a
            timeline. Particularly useful where the timing relationships
            between interactions are important. See <xref
            linkend="ch.ref.entseq"/> for details of the &argouml; sequence
            diagram and the artifacts it supports.</para></listitem>
      
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Collaboration diagram</emphasis>. Shows the
            interactions (typically messages or procedure calls) between
            instances of classes (objects) and actors against the structural
            relationships between those instances. Particularly useful where it
            is useful to relate interactions to the static structure of the
            system. See <xref linkend="ch.ref.entcollab"/> for details of the
            &argouml; collaboration diagram and the artifacts it
            supports.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist></listitem>
      </itemizedlist></listitem>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Implementation diagrams</emphasis>. UML defines
        two implementation diagrams to show the relationship between the
        software components that make up a system (the <emphasis>component
        diagram</emphasis>) and the relationship between the software and the
        hardware on which it is deployed at run-time (the <emphasis>deployment
        diagram</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The &argouml; deployment diagram provides support for both
        component and deployment diagrams. See <xref
        linkend="ch.ref.entdeploy"/> for details of the diagram and the
        artifacts it supports.</para></listitem>

  <!-- The central explanation of how the mouse behaves -->

  <sect1 id="s1.ref.mouse">
    <title>General Mouse Behavior in &argouml;</title>

    <para>Mouse behavior that is specific to the various panes of &argouml;
      (see <xref linkend="s1.ref.panes"/>) or the menu bar, is discussed in the
      chapters covering those panes and the menu bar. In this section we cover
      behavior that is general across all of &argouml;.</para>

    <para>In a number of places in &argouml; text may be directly edited
      (for example the constraint editor&mdash;see
      <xref linkend="s2.ref.details_constraint_editor"/>). The behavior of the
      mouse when handling text is discussed in the sections that follow.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Mouse Button Terminology</title>

      <para>&argouml; assumes a two button mouse. We will refer to the buttons
        as <quote>&button1;</quote> and <quote>&button2;</quote>. &Button1; is
        the leftmost button on a right-handed mouse, and sometimes referred to
        as the <emphasis>select</emphasis> button. &Button2; is the rightmost
        button on a right-handed mouse, and is sometimes referred to as the
        <emphasis>adjust</emphasis> button.</para>

      <para>A single depress and release of a mouse button while the mouse is
        referred to as a <emphasis>click</emphasis>. Two clicks in quick
        succession is referred to as a <emphasis>double
        click</emphasis>. Moving the mouse while holding a button down is
        referred to as <emphasis>button motion</emphasis> with the starting
        point being at <emphasis>button down</emphasis> and the end point at
        <emphasis>button up</emphasis>.</para>

      <title>&Button1; Click</title>

      <para>
        Clicking on an user-interface object or on a diagram artifact 
        may establish many different things. 
        Most of the behaviour is experienced quite intuitive by the user, 
        mainly because the high degree of standardisation, even spanning
        different computer platforms (Macintosh, PC, UNIX,...). 
        &argouml; follows the <emphasis>Java Look and Feel Design 
        Guidelines</emphasis> by Sun.
        Hence, behaviour of common user-interface components is generally not
        discussed in this document.
        <!-- TODO: Add URL to Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines -->
        </para>
        
        <para>
        On the other hand, mouse actions in a diagram may not seem so intuitive
        to the user, since it is specific for &argouml;. 
        Hence they are explained here.
        In short, clicking selects or activates the object beneath the mouse-pointer, 
        and moves the focus (i.e. navigation). 
        <!-- For example, 
        a click is used to activate a command button, 
        to select an artifact on a diagram or an item from a list, 
        or to set an insertion point in a text area.--> 
      </para>
      
      <para>More in detail, the &button1; click may cause the following result:
      </para>

      <!-- Selection -->

      <sect3>
        <title>Selection</title>

        <para>Here &button1; is used to choose (select) an artifact 
          (in a list or tree or on a diagram) on 
          which subsequent operations will take place. 
          Multiple artifacts may be selected 
          by using Shift and/or Control in combination with &button1;, see 
          <xref linkend="s2.ref.mouse.shift_control"/>. 
          Selection is always clearly indicated by a colored background.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          On a diagram, the selected artifact is indicated with colored "blocks"
          at the corners/ends of the object. Artifacts can be selected or 
          deselected in different ways:
        </para>
        
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              &Button1; click. Deselects all artifacts, and selects the
              one clicked on.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              &Button1; motion. Button motion 
              (moving the mouse with the button down) in the diagram, 
              not on any artifact, allows to draw a rectangle around artifacts
              which will be selected when the &button1; is released.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Menu functions and shortcuts. 
              Many menu operations change selection as side-effect, e.g.
              creating a new diagram.  
              Many keyboard shortcuts for menu operations change the selection, 
              e.g. Ctrl-A, which stands for the 
              <literal>Select All</literal> function.
            </para>

      <!-- Activation -->

      <sect3>
        <title>Activation</title>

        <para>Here &button1; is used to activate the user interface component,
          e.g. a button. 
          The object is usually highlighted when the mouse button is pressed 
          and then activated when the mouse button is released. Activating an
          user-interface object means that its function is executed.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <!-- Navigation -->

      <sect3>
        <title>Navigation</title>

        <para>Here &button1; is used to move the focus from one 
          user interface component or diagram artifact to another.
          It is better known under the term
          keyboard focus. This because keyboard commands usually work on
          the artifact that has the focus.
          The focus is indicated by a (hardly visible) box 
          <!-- TODO: not present in the explorer, see issue ... -->
          around the artifact, or for a text entry box, by a flashing cursor.

    <!-- Button1 double click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button1; Double Click</title>

        is discussed in their chapters.</para>

      <!-- General behavior when editing text -->

      <sect3>
        <title>General Behavior When Editing Text</title>

        <para>Here &button1; double click is used to select a complete word, or
          other syntactic unit within the text. Subsequent operations (text
          entry and deletion) will replace the selected text.</para>

      <title>Shift and Control with &Button1;</title>

      <!-- Where there is a list of things -->

      <sect3>
        <title>Within Lists</title>

        <para>This behavior applies where there is a list of things that may
          be selected. This includes various dialog boxes, and the to-do pane,
          where there is a list of to-do items to be selected.</para>

        <para>Where selections are to be made, the SHIFT key is used to with
          &button1; to <emphasis>extend</emphasis> from the original &button1;
          selection to the current position.</para>

        <para>Similarly the CONTROL key with &button1; is used to add
          individual items to the current selection. Where Ctrl-&button1; is
          used on an item already selected, that item is removed from the
          selection.</para>

        <caution><para>Users of Microsoft Windows might be familiar with the use
          of SHIFT-CONTROL-Click 
          (i.e. holding both the Shift and Control key down when clicking), 
          to add sub-lists to an existing
          selection. &argouml; does not support this. SHIFT-CONTROL-Click will behave

    <sect2>
      <title>Re-sizing Panes</title>

      <para>You can re-size panes by dragging on the divider bars between
