    <title>Mouse Behavior in the Editing Pane</title>

    <para>Behavior of the mouse in general, and the naming of the buttons is
      covered in the chapter on the overall user interface (see
      <xref linkend="ch.ref.ui"/>).</para>

    <!-- Button1 click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button1; Click</title>

      <para>In the tool bar of the editing pane, 
        &button1; click is used to
        select a tool for creating a new artifact and adding it to the diagram 
        (see double clicking for creating multiple artifacts).  
        For most tools, adding a new artifact
        to the diagram is achieved by moving the mouse 
        into the editing area and
        clicking again.</para>

      <para>In the main editing area &button1; click is used to select an
        individual artifact.</para>

      <para>Many artifacts (e.g. actor, class) show special handles
        when selected and the mouse hovers over them. 
        These are
        called <quote>Selection Action Buttons</quote>, see <xref
        linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_selection_action_buttons"/>.
        They appear at the sides, top and bottom, 
        and indicate a relationship type.
        Clicking on a Selection Action Button creates a new related artifact, 
        with the relation of the type that was indicated. 
        If the shift key
        is pressed when hovering the mouse over a selected artifact,
        sometimes different handles are shown, 
        which stand for different relation types. 
      </para>

      <para>Where &button2; click has been used to bring up a context sensitive
        pop-up menu (see below), &button1; click is used to select the menu
entry required.
The pop-up menu will be removed by any &button1; click 
outside of the menu area.
</para>

      <para>There are various more detailed effects, which are discussed under
        the descriptions of the various tools (see <xref
        linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_tool_bar"/>).</para>

    <!-- Button1 double click -->

    <sect2 id="s2.ref.edit_button1_double_click">
      <title>&Button1; Double Click</title>

      <para>When used on the tool bar with a tool to add an artifact, the
        selected artifact will be added multiple times to the drawing area,
        once for each further button click, until the tool is again selected or
        another tool chosen.
        <!-- This last part does not work, see issue 3145. -->
        <!-- TODO Make issue for the bug: The status area should indicate 
        e.g. "Click to place Class" not only the first time! -->
      </para>

      <para>When used within the drawing area on an artifact that has
        sub-components, double click will select the sub-component
        for editing
        (creating it if necessary).</para> 

      <para>For example double clicking over an operation compartment of a
        class will select the operation. Or create one if there is none yet.
      </para>

      <para>A special use is with package artifacts on the class diagram. A
        double click on a package will navigate to the class diagram associated
        with a package (the first created if there is more than one), or will
        offer to create one for you if there is none.

    <!-- Button1 Motion -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button1; Motion</title>

      <para>When adding an artifact using the toolbar, &button1; motion can
        generally be used to define the size of the new artifact. Its
        dimensions (line ends, diagonal corners of a rectangular artifact etc)
        are defined by &button1; down and &button1; up.</para>

      <para>Where the artifact being added is some form of connector its
        termination point is shown with &button1; up over the terminating
        artifact. &button1; click may be used in the space between artifacts to
        create articulation points in the connector. This is particularly
        useful where connectors must loopback on themselves.</para>
<!-- TODO: Rewrite the 2 paragraphs above into something understandable. -->

      <para>Over graphical artifacts &button1; motion will move the artifact to
        a new position.
      </para>
      
      <para>Graphical artifacts that are selected show handles 
        at the corners or ends, and
        these can be used for re-sizing.</para>

      <para>Some artifacts (e.g. actor, class) show special handles 
        (called <quote>Selection Action Buttons</quote>, see <xref
        linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_selection_action_buttons"/>)
        at the
        sides, top and bottom, which can be dragged to form types of
        relationship with other artifacts.</para>

      <para>Where the artifact is some form of connector between other items,
        &button1; motion other than at a handle will cause a new handle to be
        created, allowing the connector to be articulated at that point.
        This only works when the connecting line is not straight angled.
        Such new handles can be removed by moving them to the end of the
        connector.</para>

      <para>There are various more detailed effects, which are discussed under
        the descriptions of the various tools (see <xref
        linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_tool_bar"/>).</para>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Shift and control keys -->

    <sect2>
      <title>Shift and Control with &Button1;</title>

      <para>Where multiple selections are to be made, the CTRL key is used with
        &button1; to <emphasis>add</emphasis> unselected artifacts to the
        current selection. Where an artifact is already selected, it is removed
        from the current selection.
      </para>

      <para>Clicking &Button1; while the SHIFT key is pressed, 
        invokes the broom tool, which causes the selected
        artifacts (and any others swept up with them) to be moved with the
        broom tool (see <xref linkend="s2.ref.edit_layout"/>).</para>
        
      <!--para>
        However, if the CONTROL key is pressed while moving an artifact, 
        then the artifact's
        movement is constrained to one orthogonal direction, i.e. either
        vertical or horizontal, depending on the first movement made.

        while the ALT key is pressed, 
        allows to scroll the canvas in all directions with &button1; motion.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Button2 click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button2; Actions</title>

      <para>When used over artifacts in the the editing pane, this will display
        a context dependent pop-up menu. Menu entries are highlighted (but not
        selected) and sub-menus exposed by subsequent mouse motion (without any
        buttons). Menu entry selection is with &button1; or &button2;. 
        See <xref
        linkend="s1.ref.edit_pane_pop_up"/> for details of the specific pop-up
        menus.</para>

      <para>In case multiple elements are selected, the  
        pop-up menu only appears if all the items are of the same kind.
        The functions apply to all selected elements, 
        but in the V0.18 implementation of &argouml;, 
        many work only on one element,
        or even misbehave.

  <!-- The Broom -->
  
  <sect1 id="s1.ref.edit_pane_broom">
    <title>The Broom</title>
    
    <para>&argouml;'s broom alignment tool is specialized to support the needs 
      of designers in achieving the kind of alignment used in UML diagrams. 
      It is common for designers to roughly align objects as they are created 
      or by using simple movement commands. 
      The broom is an easy way to precisely align objects 
      that are already roughly aligned.
      Furthermore, the broom's distribution options are suited 
      to the needs of UML designers: 
      making related objects appear evenly spaced, 
      packing objects to save diagram space, 
      and spreading objects out to make room for new objects. 
      The broom also makes it easy to change 
      from horizontal to vertical alignment or 
      from left-alignment to right-alignment.
    </para>
    
    <para>The T-shaped icon in &argouml;'s diagram toolbar 
      invokes the broom alignment tool. 
      <!-- TODO: Rewrite this para into something better explaining what to do
      as user to operate the broom. -->
      When the mouse &button1; is pressed while in broom-mode, 
      the designer's initial mouse movement orients the broom 
      to face in one of four directions: north, south, east, or west. 
      After that, mouse drag events cause the broom to advance 
      in the chosen direction, withdraw, or grow in a lateral direction. 
      Like a real-world push broom, the broom tool pushes diagram elements 
      that come in contact with it. 
      This has the effect of aligning objects along the face of the broom 
      and provides immediate visual feedback 
      (see the figure below). 
      Unlike a real-world broom, moving backwards 
      allows diagram elements to return to their original position. 
      Growing the broom makes it possible to align objects 
      that are not near each other. 
      When the mouse button is released, the broom disappears 
      and the moved objects are selected 
      to make it easy to manipulate them further.

    <para>If the designer presses the space bar while using the broom, 
      objects on the face of the broom are distributed (i.e., spaced evenly). 
      &argouml;'s broom supports three distribution modes: 
      objects can be spaced evenly across the space that they use, 
      objects can be packed together with only a small gap between them, 
      or objects can be distributed evenly over the entire length 
      of the broom's face. 
      Repeatedly pressing the space bar cycles among these three 
      distribution modes 
      and displays a brief message indicating the operation just performed.

    <para>Selection-action buttons offer common operations 
      on the selected object. For example, a class node has a button at 
      12-o'clock for adding a superclass, one at 6-o'clock for adding a subclass, 
      and buttons at 3-o'clock and 9-o'clock for adding associations. 
      These buttons support a "click or drag" interaction: 
      a single click creates a new related class at a default position 
      relative to the original class and creates a generalization or association; 
      a drag from the button to an existing class creates 
      only the generalization or association; 
      and, a drag to an empty space in the diagram creates a new class 
      at the mouse position and the generalization or association. 
      &argouml; provides some automated layout support so that clicking 
      the subclass button will position the new classes so 
      that they do not overlap.
    </para>
    
    <para>Selection-action buttons are transparent. 
      They have a visibly recognizable rectangular shape and size 
      and they contain an icon that is the same as the icon used 
      for the corresponding type of design element on the standard toolbar. 
      However, these icons are unfilled line drawings with many 
      transparent pixels. 
      This allows selection-action buttons to be overlaid onto the drawing area 
      without overly obscuring the diagram itself. 
      Also, the buttons are only drawn when the mouse is over the selected 
      artifact; if any part of the diagram is obscured, 
      the mouse can simply be moved away to get a clearer view of the diagram.

    <title>Clarifiers</title>

    <para>A key feature of &argouml; are the critics, which run in parallel

      raise a to-do item, and also highlight the problem on the editing

    <para>Whatever grid is actually displayed, placement of items on the

  <sect1>
    <title>The Diagram Tab</title>

    <para>At the bottom of the editing pane is a small tab labeled as
      <literal>As Diagram</literal>. The concept is that a UML diagram can be
      displayed in a number of ways, for example as a graphical diagram or as a
      table. Each representation would have its own tab and be selected by
      &button1; click on the tab.</para>
