critics.CrAssocNameConflict-head = Resolve Association Name Conflict
critics.CrAssocNameConflict-desc = Every element of a namespace must have a unique name. \n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the elements and use the Properties tab to change their names.

critics.CrAttrNameConflict-head = Revise Attribute Names to Avoid Conflict
critics.CrAttrNameConflict-desc = Attributes must have distinct names.  This may be because of an inherited attribute. \n\nClear and unambiguous names are key to code generation and producing an understandable and maintainable design.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the one of the conflicting attributes of this class and change its name.

critics.CrOperNameConflict-head = Change Operation Names or Signatures in <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrOperNameConflict-desc = Two operations in <ocl>self</ocl> have the exact same signature.  Operations must have distinct signatures.  A signature is the combination of the operation's name, and parameter types (excluding return parameters).\n\nWhere there are conflicting signatures, correct code cannot be generated for mainstream OO languages. It also leads to very unclear semantics of the design.\n\nTo fix this, select the one of the conflicting operations of this class and change its name or parameters.

critics.CrCircularAssocClass-head = Circular Association
critics.CrCircularAssocClass-desc = AssociationClasses cannot include roles that refer directly back to the AssociationClass.

critics.CrCircularInheritance-head = Remove <ocl>self</ocl>'s Circular Inheritance
critics.CrCircularInheritance-desc = Inheritances relationships cannot have cycles. \n\nA legal class inheritance hierarchy is needed for code generation and the correctness of the design.

critics.CrCircularComposition-head = Remove Circular Composition
critics.CrCircularComposition-desc = Composition relationships (black diamonds) cannot have cycles. \n\nA legal aggregation hierarchy is needed for code generation and the correctness of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select one of the  associations in the cycle and remove it or change its aggregation to something other than composite.

critics.CrCrossNamespaceAssoc-head = Classifier <ocl>self</ocl> not in Namespace of its Association
critics.CrCrossNamespaceAssoc-desc = Each Class, Interface or other Classifier (<ocl>self</ocl>) involved in an Association should be in the Namespace of the Association.\n\nIf this is not the case, then there will be no way for the Classes, Interfaces or other Classifiers to name the reference to each other using the Association.\n\nNote that this critic currently does not interpret hierarchical namespaces. It will trigger if the final components of the namespaces are different, even if they share a common root, and this critic should be interpreted in the light of this.\n\nTo fix this, delete the association, and recreate it in a diagram, whose namespace includes the classes, interfaces and classifiers involved.

critics.CrDupParamName-head = Duplicate Parameter Name
critics.CrDupParamName-desc = Each parameter of an operation must have a unique name. \n\nClean and unambigous naming is needed for code generation and to achieve clear and maintainable designs.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually rename one of the parameters to this operation.

critics.CrDupRoleNames-head = Duplicate end (role) names for <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrDupRoleNames-desc = Association <ocl>self</ocl> has two (or more) roles with the same name.\n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design.\n\nTo fix this manually select <ocl>self</ocl> and use the Properties tab to change one or more of the conflicting role names.

critics.CrFinalSubclassed-head = Remove leaf keyword or remove subclasses from <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrFinalSubclassed-desc = The keyword 'leaf' indicates that a class is not intended to have subclasses.  This class or interface is marked as 'leaf' and has subclasses.\n\nA well thought-out class inheritance hierarchy that conveys and supports intended extensions is an important part of achieving an understandable and maintainable design.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the class and change its base class, or select the base class and use the properties tab to remove the 'leaf' keyword.

critics.CrIllegalGeneralization-head = Illegal Generalization 
critics.CrIllegalGeneralization-desc = Model elements can only be inherit from others of the same type. \n\nA legal inheritance hierarchy is needed for code generation and the correctness of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the  generalization arrow and remove it.

critics.CrAlreadyRealizes-head = Remove Unneeded Realizes from <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrAlreadyRealizes-desc = The selected class already indirectly realizes Interface {item.extra}.  There is no need to directly realize it again.\n\nSimplifying the design is always a good idea.  You might dismiss this \"to do\" item if you want to make it very explicit that the selected Class realizes this Interface.\n\nTo fix this, select the Realization (dashed line with white triangular arrowhead) and press the \"Delete\" key.

critics.CrInterfaceAllPublic-head = Operations in Interfaces must be public
critics.CrInterfaceAllPublic-desc = Interfaces are intended to specify the set of operations that other classes must implement.  They must be public. \n\nA well-designed set of interfaces is a good way to define the possible extensions of a class framework. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the operations of the interface and use the Properties tab to make them public.

critics.CrInterfaceOperOnly-head = Interfaces may only have operations
critics.CrInterfaceOperOnly-desc = Interfaces are intended to specify the set of operations that \nother classes must implement.  They do not implement these \noperations themselves, and cannot have attribues. \n\nA well-designed set of interfaces is a good way to define the \npossible extensions of a class framework. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the  \ninterface and use the Properties tab to remove all attributes.

critics.CrMultipleAgg-head = Two aggregate ends (roles) in binary Association
critics.CrMultipleAgg-desc = Only one end (role) of a binary Association can be aggregate or composite.\n\nAggregation and composition are used to indicate whole-part relationships and by defintion, the \"part\" end cannot be aggregate.\n\nTo fix this, select \"Next>\" to use the wizard, or manually select the Association and set some of its role aggregations to None.

critics.CrNWayAgg-head = Aggregate end (role) in 3-way (or more) Association
critics.CrNWayAgg-desc = Three-way (or more) Associations can not have aggregate ends (roles).\n\nAggregation and composition are used to indicated whole-part relationships, and by definition can only apply to binary associations between artifacts.\n\nTo fix this, manually select the Association and set the aggregation of each of its ends (roles) to None.

critics.CrNavFromInterface-head = Remove Navigation from Interface via Association <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrNavFromInterface-desc = Associations involving an interface can be not be navigable in the direction from the interface.  This is because interfaces contain only operation declarations and cannot hold pointers to other objects.\n\nThis part of the design should be changed before you can generate code from this design.  If you do generate code before fixing this problem, the code will not match the design.\n\nTo fix this, select the association and use the \"Properties\" tab to select in turn each association end that is NOT connected to the interface. Uncheck \"Navigable\" for each of these ends.\n\nThe association should then appear with a stick arrowhead pointed towards the interface\n\nNOTE. In an ideal world, ArgoUML would not permit associations to be created that were navigable from interfaces.\n\nWARNING. The current version of ArgoUML has a known defect where it creates an association between a class and interface that is either navigable in both directions, or navigable only from the interface to the class. The fix is to remove the navigation from the class end of the association and if necessary add navigation to the interface end (navigation refers to navigability TOWARDS the end) if this critic is triggered.

critics.CrUnnavigableAssoc-head = Make <ocl>self</ocl> Navigable
critics.CrUnnavigableAssoc-desc = The Association <ocl>self</ocl> is not navigable in any direction. All associations should be navigable at least one way.\n\nSetting the navigablility of associations allows your code to access data by following pointers. \n\nTo fix this, select association \"<ocl>self</ocl>\" in the diagram or navigator panel and click the properties tab.  Then use the checkboxes at the bottom of the properties panel to turn on navigablility.

critics.CrNameConflict-head = Name conflict caused by <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrNameConflict-desc = Names of contained elements in a namespace (e.g. packages) must be unique. The element <ocl>self</ocl> violates this condition. This condition does not apply for names of Associations or Generalizations.

critics.CrNameConflictAC-head = Role name conflicts with member
critics.CrNameConflictAC-desc = Association role names of an AssociationClass must not conflict \nwith the names of structural features (e.g., instance variables) \nof the class.

critics.CrMissingClassName-head = Choose a Name
critics.CrMissingClassName-desc = Every class and interface within a package must have a name. \n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the class and use the Properties tab to give it a name.

critics.CrMissingAttrName-head = Choose a name
critics.CrMissingAttrName-desc = Every attribute must have a name. \n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and \nthe understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the \nattribute and use the Properties tab to give it a name.

critics.CrMissingOperName-head = Choose a name
critics.CrMissingOperName-desc = Every operation must have a name. \n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and \nthe understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the \noperation and use the Properties tab to give it a name.

critics.CrMissingStateName-head = Choose a Name
critics.CrMissingStateName-desc = Every state within a state machine should have a name. \n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the state and use the Properties tab to give it a name, or select the state and type a name.

critics.CrNoInstanceVariables-head = Add Instance Variables to <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrNoInstanceVariables-desc = You have not yet specified instance variables for <ocl>self</ocl>. Normally classes have instance variables that store state information for each instance. Classes that provide only static attributes and methods should be stereotyped <<utility>>.\n\nDefining instance variables is needed to complete the information representation part of your design. \n\nTo fix this, press the \"Next>\" button, or add instance variables by double clicking on <ocl>self</ocl> in the navigator pane and using the Create menu to make a new attribute.

critics.CrNoAssociations-head = Add Associations to <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrNoAssociations-desc = You have not yet specified any Associations for <ocl>self</ocl>. Normally classes, actors and use cases are associated with others. \n\nDefining the associations between objects an important part of your design. \n\nTo fix this, press the \"Next>\" button, or add associations manually by clicking on the association tool in the tool bar and dragging from <ocl>self</ocl> to another node.

critics.CrNonAggDataType-head = Wrap DataType
critics.CrNonAggDataType-desc = DataTypes are not full classes and cannot be associated with classes, unless the DataType is part of a composite (black diamond) aggregation. \n\nGood OO design depends on careful choices about which entities to represent as full objects and which to represent as attributes of objects.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually replace the DataType with a full class or change the association aggregation to containment by a full class.

critics.CrOppEndConflict-head = Rename Association Roles
critics.CrOppEndConflict-desc = Two roles of <ocl>self</ocl> have the same name. Roles must have distinct names. \n\nClear and unambiguous names are key to code generation and producing an understandable and maintainable design.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the one of the conflicting roles at the far end of an association from this class and change its name.

critics.CrParamTypeNotImported-head = Import Parameter Type into Class
critics.CrParamTypeNotImported-desc = The type of each operation parameter must be visible and imported into the class that owns the operation.\n\nImporting classes is needed for code generation. Good modularization of classes into packages is key to an understandable design.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually add an import to the class that owns this operation.

critics.CrUselessAbstract-head = Define Concrete (Sub)Class
critics.CrUselessAbstract-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> can never influence the running system because it can never have any instances, and none of its subclasses can have instances either. \n\nTo fix this problem: (1) define concrete subclasses that implement the interface of this class; or (2) make <ocl>self</ocl> or one of its existing subclasses concrete.

critics.CrUselessInterface-head = Define Class to Implement <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrUselessInterface-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> can never be used because no classes implement it.\n\nTo fix this problem, press the \"Next>\" button or manually use the toolbar \"Class\" button to define classes and the \"Realizes\" button to make a relationship from the class to the highlighted interface.

critics.CrDisambigClassName-head = Choose a Unique Name for <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrDisambigClassName-desc = Every class and interface within a package must have a unique name. There are at least two elements in this package named \"<ocl>self</ocl>\".\n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select one of the conflicting classes and use the Properties tab to change their names.

critics.CrDisambigStateName-head = Choose a Unique Name for <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrDisambigStateName-desc = Every state within a state machine must have a unique name. There are at least two states in this machine named \"<ocl>self</ocl>\".\n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select one of the conflicting states and use the \"Properties\" tab to change their names.

critics.CrConflictingComposites-head = Remove Conflicting Composite Associations
critics.CrConflictingComposites-desc = A composite (black diamond) role of an association indicates that instances of that class contain instances of the associated classes. Since each instance can only be contained in one other object, each object can be the 'part' in at most one is-part-of relationship.\n\nGood OO design depends on building good is-part-of relationships.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually change one association to have multiplicity to 0..1 or 1..1, or another kind of aggregation (e.g., a white diamond is less strict), or remove one of the associations

critics.CrTooManyAssoc-head = Reduce Associations on <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrTooManyAssoc-desc = There are too many Associations on class <ocl>self</ocl>.  Whenever one class becomes too central to the design it may become a maintenance bottleneck that must be updated frequently. \n\nDefining the associations between objects is an important part of your design. \n\nTo fix this, press the \"Next>\" button, or remove associations manually by clicking on an association in the navigator pane or diagram and pressing the \"Del\" key.

critics.CrTooManyAttr-head = Reduce Attributes on <ocl>self</ocl>

Or you can make a new diagram...

critics.CrNoTransitions-head = Add Transitions to <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrNoTransitions-desc = State <ocl>self</ocl> has no Incoming or Outgoing transitions. Normally states have both incoming and outgoing transitions. \n\nDefining complete state transitions is needed to complete the behavioral specification part of your design.  \n\nTo fix this, press the \"Next>\" button, or add transitions manually by clicking on transition tool in the tool bar and dragging from another state to <ocl>self</ocl> or from <ocl>self</ocl> to another state.

critics.CrNoTriggerOrGuard-head = Add Trigger or Guard to Transistion
critics.CrNoTriggerOrGuard-desc = The highlighted Transition is incomplete because it has no trigger or guard condition.  Triggers are events that cause a transition to be taken.  Guard conditions must be true for the transition to be taken.  If only a guard is used, the transition is taken when the condition becomes true.\n\nThis problem must be resolved to complete the state machine.\n\nTo fix this, select the Transition and use the \"Properties\" tab, or select the Transition and type some text of the form:\nTRIGGER [GUARD] / ACTION\nWhere TRIGGER is an event name, GUARD is a boolean expression, and ACTION is an action to be performed when the Transition is taken.  All three parts are optional.

critics.CrConstructorNeeded-head = Add Constructor to <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrConstructorNeeded-desc = You have not yet defined a constructor for class <ocl>self</ocl>. Constructors initialize new instances such that their attributes have valid values.  This class probably needs a constructor because not all of its attributes have initial values.\n\nDefining good constructors is key to establishing class invariants, and class invariants are a powerful aid in writing solid code.\n\nTo fix this, add a constructor manually by clicking on <ocl>self</ocl> in the navigator pane and adding an operation using the context sensitive pop-up menu in the property tab, or select <ocl>self</ocl> where it appears on a class diagram and use the \"Add Operation\" tool. Then use the Properties tab on the Details Pane to select the <<create>> stereotype on the operation.\n\nA constructor is an operation with the stereotype <<create>>.

critics.CrNameConfusion-head = Revise Name to Avoid Confusion
critics.CrNameConfusion-desc = Names should be clearly distinct from each other. These two names are so close to each other that readers might be confused.\n\nClear and unambiguous naming is key to code generation and the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the elements and use the Properties tab to change their names.  Avoid names that differ from other names only in capitalization, or use of underscore characters, or by only one character.

critics.CrMergeClasses-head = Consider Combining Classes (<ocl>self</ocl>)
critics.CrMergeClasses-desc = The highlighted class, <ocl>self</ocl>, only participates in one association and that association is one-to-one with another class.  Since instances of these two classes must always be created together and destroyed together, combining these classes might simplify your design without loss of any representation power. However, you may find the combined class too large and complex, in which case separating them is usually better.\n\nOrganizing classes to manage complexity of the design is always important, especially when the design is already complex. \n\nTo fix this, click on the \"Next>\" button, or manually add the attribues and operations of the highlighted class to the other class, then remove the highlighted class from the project.

critics.CrSubclassReference-head = Remove Reference to Specific Subclass
critics.CrSubclassReference-desc = Class <ocl>self</ocl> has a reference to one of it's subclasses. Normally all subclasses should be treated \"equally\" by the superclass.  This allows for addition of new subclasses without modification to the superclass. \n\nDefining the associations between objects is an important part of your design.  Some patterns of associations are easier to maintain than others, depending on the nature of future changes. \n\nTo fix this, press the \"Next>\" button, or remove the association  manually by clicking on it in the diagram and pressing Delete.

critics.CrWrongLinkEnds-head = LinkEnds have not the same locations
critics.CrWrongLinkEnds-desc = In deployment-diagrams objects can reside either on components\n or on component-instances. So it is not possible to have two objects\n connected with a Link, while one object resides on an component and\n an the other object on a component-instance.\n\n\n To fix this remove one object of the two connected objects from its location to an element that has the\n same type as the location of the other object

critics.CrUnconventionalClassName-head = Capitalize Class Name <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrUnconventionalClassName-desc = Normally classes begin with a capital letter. The name '<ocl>self</ocl>' is unconventional because it does not begin with a capital.\n\nFollowing good naming conventions help to improve the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select <ocl>self</ocl> and use the Properties tab to give it a different name.

critics.CrUnconventionalPackName-head = Revise Package Name <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrUnconventionalPackName-desc = Normally package names are written in all lower case with periods used to indicate \"nested\" packages.  The name '<ocl>self</ocl>' is unconventional because it is not all lower case with periods.\n\nFollowing good naming conventions help to improve the understandability and maintainability of the design. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select <ocl>self</ocl> and use the Properties tab to give it a different name.

critics.CrClassMustBeAbstract-head = Class <ocl>self</ocl> must be abstract
critics.CrClassMustBeAbstract-desc = Classes that include or inherit abstract methods from base classes or interfaces must be marked abstract.\n\nDeciding which classes are abstract or concrete is a key part of class hierarchy design.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the class and use the properties tab to add the Abstract keyword, or manually implement each abstract operation that is inherited from a base class or interface.

critics.CrReservedName-head = Change <ocl>self</ocl> to a Non-Reserved Word
critics.CrReservedName-desc = \"<ocl>self</ocl>\" is a reserved word or very close to one.  The names of model elements must not conflict with reserved words of programming languages or UML.\n\nUsing legal names is needed to generate compilable code. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the highlighted element and use the Properties tab to give it a different name.

critics.CrMultipleInheritance-head = Change Multiple Inheritance to Interfaces
critics.CrMultipleInheritance-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> has multiple base classes, but Java does not support multiple inheritance.  You must use interfaces instead. \n\nThis change is required before you can generate Java code.\n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually (1) remove one of the base classes and then (2) optionally define a new interface with the same method declarations and (3) add it as an interface of <ocl>self</ocl>, and (4) move the method bodies from the old base class down into <ocl>self</ocl>.

critics.CrMultipleRealization-head = Change Multiple Realization in <ocl>self</ocl> to Generalizations
critics.CrMultipleRealization-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> implements multiple interfaces. Though this is legal in UML this code will not compile in java. Replace the multiple realizations with generalizations if you want to create compilable and error free code.

critics.CrIllegalName-head = Choose a Legal Name for <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrIllegalName-desc = The names of model elements must be sequences of letters, numbers, and underscores.  They cannot contain punctuation.\n\nCode generation requires legal names for the resulting code to compile correctly. \n\nTo fix this, use the \"Next>\" button, or manually select the highlighted element and use the Properties tab to give it a different name.

critics.CrUtilityViolated-head = Utility Stereotype Violated, instances can be created.
critics.CrUtilityViolated-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> is marked with the <<utility>>; stereotype, but it does not satisfy the constraints imposed on Utilities.\nIt does have instance attributes, variables or operations.\n\nIf you no longer wants this class to be a Utility, remove the <<utility>> stereotype by clicking on the class and selecting the blank selection on the stereotype drop-down within the properties tab.\n

critics.CrConsiderSingleton-head = Consider using Singleton Pattern for <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrConsiderSingleton-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> has no non-static attributes nor any associations that are navigable away from instances of this class.  This means that every instance of this class will be identical to every other instance, since there will be nothing about the instances that can differentiate them.\n\nUnder these circumstances you should consider making explicit that you have exactly one instance of this class, by using the Singleton Pattern. Using the Singleton Pattern can save time and memory space. Within ArgoUML; this can be done by using the <<singleton>> stereotype on this class.\n\nIf it is not your intent to have a single instance, you should define instance variables (i.e. non-static attributes) and/or outgoing associations that will represent differences bewteen instances.\n\nHaving specified <ocl>self</ocl> as a Singleton, you need to define the class so there can only be a single instance. This will complete the information representation part of your design. To achieve this you need to do the following.\n\n1. Define a static attribute (a class variable) holding the instance. This must therefore have <ocl>self</ocl> as its type.\n\n2. Provide only private constructors for <ocl>self</ocl> so that new instances cannot be made by other code. The creation of the single instance could be through a suitable helper operation, which invokes this private constructor just once.\n\n3. Provide at least one constructor to override the default constructor, so that the default constructor is not used to create multiple instances.\n\nIn the UML 1.3 standard, a constructor is an operation with the stereotype <<create>>.\n\nBy convention in Java and C++ a constructor has the same name as the class, is not static, and returns no value. Note that in ArgoUML this means that you must remove the return value created by default for the constructor operation.

critics.CrSingletonViolatedMissingStaticAttr-head = Singleton Stereotype Violated, missing static attribute in <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrSingletonViolatedMissingStaticAttr-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> is marked with the <<singleton>>; stereotype, but it does not satisfy the constraints imposed on Singletons.\nIt does not have a static attribute (a class variable) to hold the instance.\n\nWhenever you mark a class with a stereotype, the class should satisfy all constraints of the stereotype.  This is an important part of making a self-consistent and understandable design. Using the Singleton Pattern can save time and memory space.\n\nIf you no longer want this class to be a Singleton, remove the <<singleton>> stereotype by clicking on the class and selecting the blank selection on the stereotype drop-down within the properties tab.\n

critics.CrSingletonViolatedOnlyPrivateConstructors-head = Singleton Stereotype Violated, has non-private constructor, in <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrSingletonViolatedOnlyPrivateConstructors-desc = <ocl>self</ocl> is marked with the <<singleton>>; stereotype, but it does not satisfy the constraints imposed on Singletons.\nIt must have only private constructors so that new instances cannot be made by other code.\nWhenever you mark a class with a stereotype, the class should satisfy all constraints of the stereotype.  This is an important part of making a self-consistent and understandable design. Using the Singleton Pattern can save time and memory space.\n\nIf you no longer want this class to be a Singleton, remove the <<singleton>> stereotype by clicking on the class and selecting the blank selection on the stereotype drop-down within the properties tab.\n

critics.CrNodesOverlap-head = Clean Up Diagram <ocl>self</ocl>
critics.CrNodesOverlap-desc = Some of the objects in this diagram overlap and obscure each other. This may hide important information and make it difficult for humans to understand. A neat appearance may also make your diagrams more influencial on other designers, implementors, and decision makers.\n\nConstructing an understandable set of class diagrams is an important part of your design. \n\nTo fix this, move the highlighted nodes in the diagram.

critics.CrZeroLengthEdge-head = Make Edge More Visible
critics.CrZeroLengthEdge-desc = This edge is too small to see easily. This may hide important information and make it difficult for humans to understand. A neat appearance may also make your diagrams more influencial on other designers, implementors, and decision makers.\n\nConstructing an understandable set of diagrams is an important part of your design. \n\nTo fix this, move one or more nodes so that the highlighted edges will be longer, or click in the center of the edge and drag to make a new vertex.

critics.CrMultiComposite-head = Composite Role with Multiplicity > 1
critics.CrMultiComposite-desc = An instance may not belong by composition to more than one composite instance.\n\nThis is the second well-formedness rule on AssociationEnd in UML 1.1 and UML 1.3.

critics.CrOppEndVsAttr-head = Rename Role or Attribute
critics.CrOppEndVsAttr-desc = Two attributes may not have the same name within a Classifier.\n\nThis is the second well-formedness rule on Classifier in UML 1.1. and UML 1.3.
