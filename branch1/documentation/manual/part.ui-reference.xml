			<title>Overview of the Window</title>

			<para><xref xlink:href="fig.ref.gui_overview" /> shows the main ArgoUML window.</para>
			<para>The titlebar of the window shows the following 4 parts of information, separated from each other by a dash.</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The current filename. If no filename for the project is set yet, then the titlebar shows &quot;Unititled&quot;.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The name of the currently active diagram.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The name <quote>ArgoUML</quote>.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>An asterisk (*). This item is only present if the current project file is <quote>dirty</quote>, i.e. it is altered, but not yet saved. In other words, if the asterisk is absent, then the current file has not been altered.</para>

			<para>At the top of screen is a <emphasis>menu bar</emphasis>, which is described in <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.menu"
					 />. Below that is the <emphasis>toolbar</emphasis>, as described in <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.toolbar" />.</para>
			<para>The bulk of the window comprises four sub-windows or <emphasis>panes</emphasis>. Clockwise from top left these are the <emphasis>explorer</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.navpane" />), <emphasis>editing pane</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.editpane" />), <emphasis>details pane</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.detpane" />) and <emphasis>to-do pane</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.todopane"
					 />). All 4 panes have a <emphasis>tool bar</emphasis> at the top (in the <emphasis>details pane</emphasis> it is located under the <emphasis>properties</emphasis> tab). An overview of the panes is given in <xref
					xlink:href="s1.ref.panes"
					 />. Finally at the bottom of the window is a <emphasis>status bar</emphasis> described in <xref
					xlink:href="s1.ref.status" />.</para>
		</section>
		<section xml:id="s1.ref.mouse">
			<title>General Mouse Behavior in ArgoUML</title>
			<para>Mouse behavior that is specific to the various panes of ArgoUML (see <xref
					xlink:href="s1.ref.panes"
				 />) or the menu bar, is discussed in the chapters covering those panes and the menu bar. In this section we cover behavior that is general across all of ArgoUML.</para>
			<para>In a number of places in ArgoUML text may be directly edited (for example the constraint editor&#8212;see <xref
					xlink:href="s2.ref.details_constraint_editor"
				 />). The behavior of the mouse when handling text is discussed in the sections that follow.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Mouse Button Terminology</title>
				<para>ArgoUML assumes a two button mouse. We will refer to the buttons as <quote>button&nbsp;1</quote> and <quote>button&nbsp;2</quote>. Button&nbsp;1 is the leftmost button on a right-handed mouse, and sometimes referred to as the <emphasis>select</emphasis> button. Button&nbsp;2 is the rightmost button on a right-handed mouse, and is sometimes referred to as the <emphasis>adjust</emphasis> button.</para>
				<para>A single depress and release of a mouse button with the mouse is referred to as a <emphasis>click</emphasis>. Two clicks in quick succession is referred to as a <emphasis>double click</emphasis>. Moving the mouse while holding a button down is referred to as <emphasis>button motion</emphasis> with the starting point being at <emphasis>button down</emphasis> and the end point at <emphasis>button up</emphasis>.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Click</title>
				<para>Clicking on an user-interface object or on a diagram model element may establish many different things. Most of the behaviour is experienced quite intuitive by the user, mainly because the high degree of standardisation, even spanning different computer platforms (Macintosh, PC, UNIX,…). ArgoUML follows the <emphasis>Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines</emphasis> by Sun. See <link
						xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/"
					 />. Hence, behaviour of common user-interface components is generally not discussed in this document.</para>
				<para>On the other hand, mouse actions in a diagram may not seem so intuitive to the user, since it is specific for ArgoUML. Hence they are explained here. In short, clicking selects or activates the object beneath the mouse-pointer, and moves the focus (i.e. navigation).</para>
				<para>More in detail, the button&nbsp;1 click may cause the following result:</para>
				<section>
					<title>Selection</title>
					<para>Here button&nbsp;1 is used to choose (select) a model element (in a list or tree or on a diagram) on which subsequent operations will take place. Multiple model elements may be selected by using Shift and/or Ctrl in combination with button&nbsp;1, see <xref
							xlink:href="s2.ref.mouse.shift_control"
						 />. Selection is always clearly indicated by a colored background.</para>
					<para>On a diagram, the selected model element is indicated with colored &quot;blocks&quot; at the corners/ends of the object. Model elements can be selected or deselected in different ways:</para>
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>Button&nbsp;1 click. Deselects all model elements, and selects the one clicked on.</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Button&nbsp;1 motion. Button motion (moving the mouse with the button down) in the diagram, not on any model element, allows to draw a rectangle around model elements which will be selected when the button&nbsp;1 is released.</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Menu functions and shortcuts. Many menu operations change selection as side-effect, e.g. creating a new diagram. Many keyboard shortcuts for menu operations change the selection, e.g. Ctrl-A, which stands for the <literal>Select All</literal> function.</para>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Activation</title>
					<para>Here button&nbsp;1 is used to activate the user interface component, e.g. a button. The object is usually highlighted when the mouse button is pressed and then activated when the mouse button is released. Activating an user-interface object means that its function is executed.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Navigation</title>
					<para>Here button&nbsp;1 is used to move the focus from one user interface component or diagram model element to another. It is better known under the term keyboard focus. This because keyboard commands usually work on the model element that has the focus. The focus is indicated by a (hardly visible) box around the model element, or for a text entry box, by a flashing cursor.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>General Behavior When Editing Text</title>
					<para>Here button&nbsp;1 is used to select the point within the text at which operations (text entry and deletion) will take place.</para>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Double Click</title>
				<para>The behavior of button&nbsp;1 double click varies betweens panes and is discussed in their chapters.</para>
				<section>
					<title>General Behavior When Editing Text</title>
					<para>Here button&nbsp;1 double click is used to select a complete word, or other syntactic unit within the text. Subsequent operations (text entry and deletion) will replace the selected text.</para>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Motion</title>
				<section>
					<title>General Behavior When Editing Text</title>
					<para>Here button&nbsp;1 motion is used to select a range of text. Subsequent operations (text entry and deletion) will replace the selected text.</para>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section xml:id="s2.ref.mouse.shift_control">
				<title>Shift and Ctrl modifiers with Button&nbsp;1</title>
				<section>
					<title>Within Lists</title>
					<para>This behavior applies where there is a list of things that may be selected. This includes various dialog boxes, and the to-do pane, where there is a list of to-do items to be selected.</para>
					<para>Where selections are to be made, the SHIFT key is used to with button&nbsp;1 to <emphasis>extend</emphasis> from the original button&nbsp;1 selection to the current position.</para>
					<para>Similarly the CTRL key with button&nbsp;1 is used to add individual items to the current selection. Where Ctrl-button&nbsp;1 is used on an item already selected, that item is removed from the selection.</para>
					<caution>
						<para>Users of Microsoft Windows might be familiar with the use of SHIFT-CTRL-Click (i.e. holding both the Shift and Ctrl key down when clicking), to add sub-lists to an existing selection. ArgoUML does not support this. SHIFT-CTRL-Click will behave as CTRL-Click.</para>
					</caution>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>General Behavior When Editing Text</title>
					<para>In a number of places in ArgoUML text may be directly edited (for example when naming a model&#8212;element in the properties pane, or when typing a UML note / comment). Here SHIFT button&nbsp;1 is used to select a range of text from the previously selected point. Subsequent operations (text entry and deletion) will replace the selected text.</para>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section xml:id="s2.ref.mouse.alt">
				<title>Alt with Button&nbsp;1: Panning</title>
				<para>When holding down the Alt key during button&nbsp;1 down on a diagram, movement of the mouse pans the drawing area. The function is indicated by the mousepointer which turns into a crosshair with arrows.</para>
			</section>
			<section xml:id="s2.ref.mouse.ctrl">
				<title>Ctrl with Button&nbsp;1: Constrained Drag</title>
				<para>When holding down the Ctrl key while dragging with mouse button&nbsp;1 down on a diagram, the movement of the dragged element element will be constrained to one of eight cardinal directions : North, South, East, West, NE, SE, SW, NW. </para>

				<title>Button&nbsp;2 Actions</title>
				<para>Button&nbsp;2 actions are all dependent on the pane or menu bar, and discussed in their various chapters.</para>

		<section xml:id="s1.ref.panes">
			<title>General Information About Panes</title>
			<para>The four sub-windows of the main ArgoUML window are called <emphasis>panes</emphasis>. Clockwise from top left these are the <emphasis>explorer</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.navpane" />), <emphasis>editing pane</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.editpane" />), <emphasis>details pane</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.detpane" />) and <emphasis>to-do pane</emphasis> (see <xref
					xlink:href="ch.ref.todopane"
					 />). At the top the editing pane is a <emphasis>tool bar</emphasis>.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Re-sizing Panes</title>
				<para>You can re-size panes by dragging on the divider bars between them. To indicate this possibility, the mouse cursor changes shape when hovering over the divider bars.</para>
				<para>In addition you will see there are two small left pointing arrows within the vertical divider bars, one at the top of the vertical divider bar between explorer and editing pane and one at the top of the vertical divider bar between to-do pane and details pane. Button&nbsp;1 click on the first of these will expand the editing pane to the full width of the window, button&nbsp;1 click on the second will expand the details pane to the full width of the window.</para>
				<para>There is also a small downward pointing arrow within the horizontal divider bar at its leftmost end. Clicking on this will expand the explorer and editing panes to the full depth of the window.</para>
				<para>By using both the top arrow on the vertical divider and the arrow on the horizontal divider, it is possible to expand the editing pane to use the entire window.</para>
				<para>The original configuration can be restored by clicking again on these arrows, which are now located at the edge of the window.</para>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section xml:id="s1.ref.status">
			<title>The status bar</title>
			<para>The status bar is at the very bottom of the ArgoUML window and is used to display short advisory messages. In general such messages are self explanatory. It is e.g. used for displaying parsing error messages in case a text entered on the diagram can not be interpreted.</para>

			<title>Introduction</title>

			<para>An important principle behind ArgoUML is that actions 
        should be able to be invoked in whatever way the user finds 
        convenient. As a result many (but not all) actions that can be 
        carried out on the menu can be carried out in other ways as 
        well under ArgoUML.</para>

			<para>A number of the common menu entries are also available 
        through keyboard shortcuts.</para>

			<para>It is also be possible to navigate the menu from the 
        keyboard. Each level of each menu is identified by a letter 
        (shown underlined in the menu or entry name from the moment the 
        ALT key is pressed). This sequence of letters while holding 
        down the ALT key selects the entry. 
        </para>

			<para>The following is an explanation of why the menuitems are 
        grouped as they are.</para>

			<para>

				<itemizedlist>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>File</emphasis> menu contains 
              operations that affect on the whole project/file. All the 
              items in this menu can be explained as such.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Edit</emphasis> menu is generally 
              intended for editing the model or changing the content of 
              a diagram. It also contains functions to enable editing, 
              like e.g. selecting. This menu is not intended for 
              diagram layout functions. Most functions here do 
              something with the selected modelelement and diagram. The 
              items &quot;Configure Perspectives…&quot;
              and &quot;Settings…&quot; are a bit different,
              since they adjust the way ArgoUML works - but they do not 
              belong in the File menu, since their settings are not
              stored in the project.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>View</emphasis> menu is for functions 
              that do never alter the model, nor the diagram layout, 
              only the way you view the diagram. A good example is
              &quot;zoom&quot;. 
              Also navigational functions belong here, e.g. &quot;Find&quot; 
              and &quot;Goto Diagram…&quot;. All changes of settings 
              in this menu apply to all diagrams (e.g. zoom).</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Create</emphasis> menu contains all 
              possible diagrams that can be created. 
              These functions are
              context dependend, since they work on the 
              selected modelelement.
              </para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Arrange</emphasis> menu allows layout 
              changes in the current diagram, which is not the same as 
              the items in the View menu. Functions here can not alter 
              the UML model.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Generation</emphasis> menu is for 
              Code Generation. The functions here work either on the 
              selected modelelements, or on the whole project.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Critique</emphasis> menu is specific 
              for settings related to critics, 
              which apply for all  projects.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Tools</emphasis> menu is currently 
              empty. If 
              plugins are installed, then their functions appear 
              here.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>The <emphasis>Help</emphasis> menu contains the 
              usual &quot;information&quot; and 
              &quot;about&quot;.</para>

				<para>This initializes a new project within ArgoUML. The 
          project is created without a the name. It contains a 
          (top-level) <literal>Model</literal> named <literal>
          untitledModel</literal> and two empty diagrams: a class 
          diagram and a use case diagram.</para>

				<caution>

					<para><literal>untitledModel</literal> is not a 
            conventional model name (most processes suggest models 
            should be build from lower case letters). ArgoUML permits 
            you to use any case letters, but a critic will trigger to 
            warn that this is not conventional. See 
            <xref
							xlink:href="s1.ref.model" /> for a discussion of 
            this.</para>

				</caution>

				<para>If the model has been altered (as indicated by the 
          &quot;*&quot; in the titlebar of ArgoUML&#039;s window), then 
          activating the &quot;New&quot; function is potentionally not 
          the user&#039;s intention, since it will erase the changes. 
          Hence a confirmation dialog appears to allow the user to save 
          his work first, or cancel the operation completely.</para>

				<para>This menu-item allows you to throw away all your recent

				<para>When this menu-item is activated, a small confirmation 
          dialog box opens, as shown in the figure below. This warning 
          that all recent changes will be discarded, is needed because

				<para>In some cases, when the printing is started, the dialog

          appears. Selecting the &quot;Fit to page&quot; button does 
          print the whole diagram fitted on one page by scaling it 
          down. Which might cause all text to be too small to read in 
          case of big diagrams, but it is a quick and easy way to get 
          an usable printout. Selecting the &quot;Multiple pages&quot; 
          option does print unscaled, by dividing the diagram in 
          pieces, on as many pages as needed. Pressing the close button 
          of the dialog does the former option.</para>

					<para>If the current diagram contains no selected

            to page&quot; choice in the dialog box descibed above), 
            then the scaling is done on basis of the selected model elements 
            only. If scaling is not chosen (or in case it is not 
            needed), then all pages containing a selected model element are 
            printed.</para>

						<para>This feature is presumably added to ArgoUML 
                because guillemots are poorly supported by various

                in the diagram.
                In UML the notation is "+" for public, "-" for private,
                "#" for protected, and "~" for package.

                In UML notation, the multiplicity is shown between [], such as: 
                <literal>+newAttr [0..*] : int</literal>.
                This setting has no impact on showing multiplicity

                the initial value of e.g. attributes in the diagram.
                In UML notation, the initial value is shown e.g. like this:

					</listitem>

					<listitem>
						<para><literal>Show properties</literal> (clear by 
                default). If this is selected, then ArgoUML will show
                various properties between braces {}.
                E.g. for an attribute, it may show:
                <literal>+newAttr : int { frozen }</literal>.

						<para><literal>Show types and parameters</literal>

                and operations are shown without parameters.
                This feature may be usefull during 
                the analysis phase of your project.
                If all checkmarks in 
                the Notation Tab are unchecked, then

					<listitem>
						<para><literal>Default shadow width</literal> (set to 1

                for esthetical reasons. 
                Use this setting to adjust the 
                size of the shadow, used when the modelelement is created.
                The details tab "Presentation" allows to set the shadow per
                modelelement, after they are created, but ArgoUML V0.22 does
                not retain this latter change after save and load.

              Selects all model elements on the current pane or in the 
              current field. The exact behaviour depends on the 
              <literal>current pane</literal> (i.e. the last one you 
              clicked in): explorer pane, editing pane, to-do pane, 
              details pane. One rule applies in all cases though: the 
              selection on the diagram (editing pane) and in the 
              explorer are always synchronised.</para>

						<para>If the editing pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: First everything in the explorer and on 
              the current diagram is deselected, and then everything 
              that is on the current diagram is selected (and if the 
              same items apear in the explorer, then they are also 
              there indicated as selected, because they are always 
              synchronised).</para>

						<para>If the explorer pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: All visible items in the explorer pane 
              are selected, and non-visible items are deselected.</para>

						<para>If the to-do pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: All visible items in the to-do pane are 
              selected, and non-visible items are deselected. In fact, 
              this works the same as for the explorer pane, because 
              both are tree structures.</para>

						<para>If the details pane is the <literal>current 
              pane</literal>: The function only works when the cursor 
              is in certain fields, where selecting is possible, e.g. a 
              Name field. In such a case, the Select All function

							<para><literal>Notation Language</literal> (

                (i.e. language: UML, Java,…) used on the diagrams 
                for new projects. 
                Suppose that a designer indicates that the 
                default notation of a project is Java.
                When he saves the project, 
                the choice for Java is stored inside the project file.
                If someone else is viewing the 
                diagram, he will see the Java notation, too.
                This person can select the UML notation in the 
                File - Notation menu, and see all diagrams in UML language.

							<para>This feature is presumably added to ArgoUML

							<para>Independent of the way they are shown, 
                when entering stereotypes, you can always type

                in the diagram.
                In UML the notation is "+" for public, "-" for private,
                "#" for protected, and "~" for package. 
                E.g. for an attribute, it may show:

                In UML notation, the multiplicity is shown between [], such as: 
                <literal>+newAttr [0..*] : int</literal>.
                This setting has no impact on showing multiplicity

				<para>The <literal>Name and Location</literal> specifies the

				<itemizedlist>

					<listitem>

						<para>A text box labeled <literal>Element Name:</literal> 
              specifies the name of the model element to search 
              for. Wild cards (<literal>*</literal>, <literal>

              to find expressions previously used.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>A text box labeled <literal>In Diagram:</literal> 
              specifies which diagrams are to be searched. Again wild 
              cards may be used. Both these two text boxes have a 
              default entry of <literal>*</literal>, i.e. match 
              anything.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>To the right of these two text boxes, a selector 
              labeled <literal>Element Type:</literal> allows you to 
              specify the UML metaclass for which you are 
              searching.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>A selector labeled <literal>Find in:</literal> 
              allows the search to be made over the entire project (the 
              default) or as a sub-search over the results of a 
              previous search. When opened, a list of all the search 
              result tabs appears.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>Beneath these boxes is the button <literal>Clear 
              Tabs</literal>. This clears the display of tabs with the 
              results from previous searches (see below). This button 
              is downlighted if there are no tabs but the <literal>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>And finally, there is the button <literal>
              Find</literal>. This causes the search specified in the 
              text boxes and selectors above to be executed. The 
              results are displayed in a tab taking up the lower two 
              thirds of the page.</para>

					</listitem>

				</itemizedlist>

				<para>The lower two thirds of the dialog comprises an initial 
          tab (labeled <literal>Help</literal>) giving summary help, 
          and further tabs displaying the results of searches. These 
          search tabs are labeled with a summary of the search 
          <emphasis>element</emphasis>
					<literal>in</literal>
					<emphasis>diagram</emphasis> and are 
          divided horizontally in two halves.</para>

				<para>Button&nbsp;1 double clicking on these tabs removes the tab, 
          and spawns a new window that contains the tab contents, i.e. 
          the search results. This window can be moved and sized at 
          will. This does not work for the help tab.</para>

				<para>The top half is labeled <literal>Search 
          Results:</literal> followed by a count of the number of items 
          found. It comprises a table with one row for each
          model element and four columns. The width of the columns can be 
          adjusted.</para>

              is visible on a diagram, this lists the name of the 
              diagram, otherwise it shows <literal>N/A</literal>.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para><literal>Description</literal>. Contains a 
              description of the model element. In ArgoUML V0.18 
              this seems to be restricted to the single entry <literal>
              docs</literal>.</para>

					</listitem>

				</itemizedlist>

				<para>Button&nbsp;1 click on any row will give more information on 
          that model element by showing related model elements in the bottom half 
          (see below). Double click on any row describing a model element 
          on a diagram and that item and diagram will be 
          selected.</para>

				<para>The bottom half of the tab is a table labeled <literal>
          Related Elements:</literal> and is a table with the same 
          columns as the top half. When a model element has been 
          selected in the top half, this table shows the details of any 
          related elements.</para>

				<tip>

					<para>Enlarging the dialog vertically shows that the 
            &quot;Related Items&quot; part changes in size, but not the 
            Search results part. However, between them is a divider 
            line and when hovering over this line, the mouse pointer 
            changes into a sizing icon, and the border between these 2 
            areas can be moved up or down to redistribute the space in 
            the window.</para>

				</tip>

				<warning>

					<para>This dialog box is not modal, which allows it to 
            remain open while editing the model for easy navigation. 
            But the V0.22 implementation of ArgoUML does not inmediately 
            update the dialog box with changes made to the found 
            model elements: change of model element name, change of diagram name. 
            Deletion of a diagram does not stop the possibility to 
            navigate to it.

				</figure>

				<para>This dialog controls the behavior of individual 
          critics. To the left is a list of all the critics, to enable 
          them to be switched on or off individually. For each critic 
          there are three columns, labeled <literal>Active</literal>, 
          <literal>Headline</literal> and <literal>Snoozed</literal>. 
          The first of these is a check box, which may be toggled with 
          button&nbsp;1 click. The second is the headline name of the 
          critic, the third indicates if the critic has been snoozed 
          from the to-do pane (see <xref
						xlink:href="ch.ref.todopane"
						 />. A 
          critic is only really active if the box in the first column 
          is checked <emphasis>and</emphasis> the critic has not been 
          snoozed.</para>

				<para>Any critic for which the box in the first column is 
          unchecked is inactive and will not trigger. In addition any 
          to-do items associated with that critic will be removed from 
          the to-do pane.</para>

				<para>The V0.20 version of ArgoUML has a total of 90 critics, 
          a few of which are incompletely implemented. They are 
          described in detail by design issue category in the chapter 
          on critics (see <xref
						xlink:href="ch.ref.critics" />).</para>

				<para>To the right of the list are a series of fields, titled 
          <literal>Critic Details</literal>, giving detailed control 
          over individual critics. Selecting a critic in the list on 
          the left will populate the fields for that critic.</para>

				<para>The first field on the right is titled <literal>Critic 
          Class:</literal> and then the full name of the class in 
          ArgoUML that implements the critic. This name can be used as 
          unique identifier of the critique, e.g. in conversations 
          about the critic.</para>

				<para>The first field below this title is a text box labeled 
          <literal>Headline:</literal> giving the complete headline of 
          the critic (which may be truncated in the list on the 
          left).</para>

				<note>

					<para>In the headline you may see the text <literal>
            &lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be 
            replaced by the name of the model element in question when the 
            critic is triggered.</para>

				</note>

				<para>The next field is a drop-down selector, labeled 
          <literal>Priority:</literal>. The three options available are 
          <literal>High</literal>, <literal>Medium</literal> and 
          <literal>Low</literal> and specify the priority category of 
          any to-do item generated by this critic. This does not alter 
          the priority of the already existing todo items, only the 
          newly generated ones. Changing the priority of a critic is 
          not saved persistently.</para>

				<para>The next field is labeled <literal>MoreInfo:</literal> 
          and contains a URL pointing to further information with a 
          button to the right labeled <literal>Go</literal> to navigate 
          to that URL.</para>

				<warning>

					<para>In the V0.20 release of ArgoUML there is no further 
            information available, and the <literal>Go</literal> button 
            is always grayed out and disabled.</para>

				</warning>

				<para>The next field is labeled <literal>
          Description:</literal> and is a text area with a detailed 
          explanation of what this critic means. If the text is too 
          large for the area a scroll bar is provided to the 
          right.</para>

				<note>

					<para>In this text area you may see the text <literal>
            &lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be 
            replaced by the name of the model element in question when the 
            critic is triggered.</para>

				</note>

				<para>The last field is a drop-down selector labeled <literal>
          Use Clarifier</literal>, with three options, <literal>
          Always</literal>, <literal>If Only One</literal> and <literal>
          Never</literal>.</para>

				<para>Clarifiers are the icons and wavy red underlines drawn 
          on the actual diagrams to indicate the artefact to which the 
          critic refers. The original intention was to make the mapping 
          from critics to clarifiers somewhat customizable.</para>

				<para>For example one user might make a <literal>Missing 
          Name</literal> critic show a red underline, another user 
          might turn off the clarifier, or have it draw a wavy green 
          underline or a blue questionmark. Critics with their 
          clarifier&#039;s disabled would still produce feedback that 
          is listed in the to-do pane.</para>

				<caution>

					<para>In the V0.20 release of ArgoUML this selector has no 
            function whatsoever. It is for future development.</para>

				</caution>

				<para>Underneath the fields are three buttons in a horizontal 
          row.</para>

				<itemizedlist>

					<listitem>

						<para><literal>Wake</literal>. It is possible to snooze a 
              critic from the to-do pane (see 
              <xref
								xlink:href="ch.ref.todopane"
							 />), which makes the 
              critic inactive for a period. If the critic has been 
              snoozed, this button is enabled and will wake the critic 
              back up again. Otherwise it is grayed out.</para>

						<tip>

							<para>You can tell a snoozed critic, because in the 
                list on the left it will be indicated in the third 
                column.</para>

					<listitem>

						<para><literal>Edit Network</literal>. Right now critics 
              are implemented in java code. That means end-users cannot 
              add new critics.</para>

						<para>The idea of a critic network is that they would be 
              a state machine like diagram with several steps. Each 
              step would express a condition which, collectively with 
              the other steps associated with that critic, articulates 
              the <quote>rule</quote> that the critic is providing. If 
              the rule fires, then remaining steps would define the 
              steps of the wizard to help the user fix the 
              problem.</para>

						<para>The ideas behind this are discussed in Chapter 4 of 
              Jason Robbins PhD disseration (
              <link

								>http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/diss4.html</link>. 
              In particular look at Figure 1-6 in this chapter and the 
              related discussion.</para>

						<para>A suggested implementation is that the conditions 
              could be written in OCL against the UML meta-model. A 
              library of predefined conditions and steps would allow 
              end-users to build new critics by combining those in 
              novel ways.</para>

			<para>An important feature, related to the cognitive psychology

				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Motion</title>

				<para>Button&nbsp;1 motion means that you pick up one or more

				<section>
					<title>From Explorer to Explorer</title>
					<para>
          Releasing the mouse button above a namespace, 
          makes the modelelement owned by the namespace.
          In the Package-centric explorer perspective, this
          means a straigh-forward drag-and-drop function.

					<para>Use this drap and drop feature to easily move

		  </para>
				</section>

				<section>
					<title>From Explorer to Diagram</title>
					<para>Dropping a modelelement on the diagram 
          is the equivalent of the "Add to Diagram" function.
          Hence, if the diagram did not yet show this modelelement, 
          it is added.
		  </para>

					<para>Use this drap and drop feature e.g. to easily create

				</figure>

				<para>The top half of the dialog contains a list of all the 
          currently defined perspectives and to the right a series of 
          buttons stacked vertically. Button&nbsp;1 click can be used to 
          select a perspective. You can select only one perspective at 
          a time.</para>

				<para>Selecting a perspective reveals a text field above the 
          list, where the name of the perspective can be edited.</para>

				<para>The lower half of the dialog contains two list areas. 
          The one on the left, labeled <literal>
          Rules Library</literal>, contains the list of available rules 
          that may be used to create the perspective. The one on the 
          right, labeled <literal>Selected Rules</literal> contains the 
          actual rules chosen for the perspective that has been 
          selected in the list of perspectives at the top. In both 
          lists, you can select only one rule at a time.</para>

				<para>Separating the two areas in the lower half of the 
          dialog are buttons labeled <literal>&gt;&gt;</literal> and 
          <literal>&lt;&lt;</literal>. The first of these transfers the 
          rule selected in the library on the left to the list of rules 
          on the right&#8212;i.e. it adds a rule to the perspective. The 
          second one transfers the rule selected on the right to the 
          library list on the left&#8212;i.e. it removes a rule from the 
          perspective.</para>

				<para>If you hover the mouse over the horizontal line that 
          separates the two halves of the dialog, then you see it 
          change shape, to indicate that you can grab this line and 
          drag it up or down.</para>

				<para>All three titles of the lists show the number of 
          items in the list. ArgoUML V0.24 has 9 default perspectives, 
          and 72 rules in the library to build perspectives from.</para>

				<para>The buttons at the top right are explained as

				<para>At the very bottom right is a button labeled <literal>
          OK</literal> to be used when all changes are complete. 
          button&nbsp;1 click on this button will close the dialog window. 
          The changes are saved when you exit ArgoUML in 
          the <literal>argo.user.properties</literal> file.</para>

				<para>Then there is the <literal>Cancel</literal> button, 
          which cancels all changes made in the dialog. Pressing the

          same effect as pressing the cancel button.</para>

          <title>The Explorer Panes</title>

          <para>The explorer was conceived as being able to offer 
          multiple views simultaneously, with up to three panels of 
          hierarchy. A dialog offers control of these panels, with an 
          option to show or not show each panel, and the option of the 
          second and third panels to be rooted at the selection on the 
          previous panel, or to show the previously used 
          hierarchy.</para>

          <caution>

            <para>This functionality is not yet implemented in ArgoUML. 
            The dialog is never shown.</para>

          </caution>

          <para>When using the explorer, it is worth bearing in mind 
          that this is a useful visualization of the model, it is not 
          <emphasis>solely</emphasis> for navigation and selection. It 
          is also useful for users to easily (meaning a few mouse 
          clicks without having to arrange a diagram) visualize the 
          model structured according to some perspective. For example, 
          show me the state nesting, or show me the class inheritance 
          tree, or show me the package nesting, or show me the list of 
          actors.</para>

          <para>The idea with the second and third explorer tree panes, 
          is that sometimes it is easier to explore the tree to a 
          certain level in one tree and then continue expanding in a 
          second tree. Since each tree will not be so deep, it will 
          look more like a list.</para>

          <para>For example, look at the way javadocs are viewed with 
          frames: the packages are selected from one list, and 
          interfaces, classes, and exceptions in that package are shown 
          in a second pane. In the case of javadocs, the second pane 
          has a tree with three roots that are always expanded, but it 
          is visually presented as three lists with three 
          headers.</para>

          <para>The other suggested use of a second or third nav panel 
          is to list recently visited model elements. This is simliar 
          to the recently visited files listed on the <literal>
          File</literal> menu of most applications, but for model 
          elements rather than files.</para>

          <para>The motivtion is the fact that designers frequently 
          <quote>interrupt</quote> themselves: they are thinking of 
          working on one part of the design, and then they make a 
          decision that needs a change in some other part, and then 
          that has an implication on some other part, and… and… and… 
          the designer forgets what it was they were originally trying 
          to accomplish. They need to <quote>pop their mental 
          stack</quote> to come back to finish what the started. If 
          they fail to do that, they leave half-finished fragments all 
          over the design which always seem to come out as soon as it 
          is presented to someone else.</para>

          <para>A recently visited list should be LIFO (stack) ordered, 
          or FIFO (queue) ordered. The goal would be to help designers 
          come back to finish what they were doing, or simply to help 
          them switch between two or three related parts of the design. 
          The <literal>Navigate Back</literal> and <literal>Navigate 
          Forward</literal> buttons in the toolbar serve the same basic 
          purpose and use a lot less screen space.</para>

          <para>Tear-off tabs would also help with alternating between 
          views, but sometimes users don&#039;t want to work with so 
          many separate windows.</para>

          <para>This is the theory that motivates the idea of multiple 
          nav panes. For more information see Jason Robbins&#039; PhD 
          dissertation 
          <link xlink:href="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/">
          http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</link>. 
          One practical usability concern is available screen space and 
          another is visual complexity. For this reason the multiple 
          panes have yet to be implemented in ArgoUML while more 
          pressing issues are addressed.</para>

					<para>Some applications (such as Doors from Telelogic) 
          require the background color

							<para>Deleting a statechart diagram also deletes the

			<section>

				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Click</title>

				<para>In the tool bar of the editing pane, button&nbsp;1 click is 
          used to select a tool for creating a new model element and adding 
          it to the diagram (see double clicking for creating multiple 
          model elements). For most tools, adding a new model element to the 
          diagram is achieved by moving the mouse into the editing area 
          and clicking again.</para>

				<para>In the main editing area button&nbsp;1 click is used to 
          select an individual model element.</para>

				<para>Many model elements (e.g. actor, class) show special handles 
          when selected and the mouse hovers over them. These are 
          called <quote>Selection Action Buttons</quote>, see 
          <xref
						xlink:href="s1.ref.edit_pane_selection_action_buttons"
					 />. 
          They appear at the sides, top and bottom, and indicate a 
          relationship type. Clicking on a Selection Action Button 
          creates a new related model element, with the relation of the type 
          that was indicated. If the shift key is pressed when hovering 
          the mouse over a selected model element, sometimes different 
          handles are shown, which stand for different relation 
          types.</para>

				<para>Where button&nbsp;2 click has been used to bring up a 
          context sensitive pop-up menu (see below), button&nbsp;1 click is 
          used to select the menu entry required. The pop-up menu will 
          be removed by any button&nbsp;1 click outside of the menu 
          area.</para>

				<para>There are various more detailed effects, which are 
          discussed under the descriptions of the various tools (see 
          <xref

			<section xml:id="s2.ref.edit_button1_double_click">

				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Double Click</title>

				<para>When used on the tool bar with a tool to add a 
          model element, the selected model element will be added multiple times 
          to the drawing area, once for each further button click, 
          until the tool is again selected or another tool 
          chosen.</para>

				<para>When used within the drawing area on a model element that 
          has sub-components, double click will select the 
          sub-component for editing (creating it if necessary).</para>

				<para>For example double clicking over an operation 
          compartment of a class will select the operation. Or create 
          one if there is none yet.</para>

				<para>A special use is with package model elements on the class 
          diagram. A double click on a package will navigate to the

				<title>Button&nbsp;1 Motion</title>

				<!-- This has never worked AFAIK!
          <para>When adding a model element using the toolbar, button&nbsp;1 
          motion can generally be used to define the size of the new 
          model element. Its dimensions (line ends, diagonal corners of a 
          rectangular model element etc) are defined by button&nbsp;1 down and 
          button&nbsp;1 up.</para>
          -->

				<para>Where the model element being added is some form of 
          connector its termination point is shown with button&nbsp;1 up 
          over the terminating model element. button&nbsp;1 click may be used in 
          the space between model elements to create articulation points in 
          the connector. This is particularly useful where connectors 
          must loopback on themselves.</para>

				<para>Over graphical model elements button&nbsp;1 motion will move the 
          model element to a new position.</para>

				<para>Graphical model elements that are selected show handles at 
          the corners or ends, and these can be used for 
          re-sizing.</para>

				<para>Some model elements (e.g. actor, class) show special handles 
          (called <quote>Selection Action Buttons</quote>, see 
          <xref
						xlink:href="s1.ref.edit_pane_selection_action_buttons"
					 />) 
          at the sides, top and bottom, which can be dragged to form 
          types of relationship with other model elements.</para>

				<para>Where the model element is some form of connector between 
          other items, button&nbsp;1 motion other than at a handle will 
          cause a new handle to be created, allowing the connector to 
          be articulated at that point. This only works when the 
          connecting line is not straight angled. Such new handles can 
          be removed by moving them to the end of the connector.</para>

				<para>There are various more detailed effects, which are 
          discussed under the descriptions of the various tools (see 
          <xref
						xlink:href="s1.ref.edit_pane_tool_bar" />).</para>

				<title>Shift and Ctrl modifiers with Button&nbsp;1</title>

				<para>Where multiple selections are to be made, the CTRL key 
          is used with button&nbsp;1 to <emphasis>add</emphasis> unselected 
          model elements to the current selection. Where a model element is 
          already selected, it is removed from the current 
          selection.</para>

				<para>Clicking Button&nbsp;1 while the SHIFT key is pressed, 
          invokes the broom tool, which causes the selected model elements 
          (and any others swept up with them) to be moved with the 
          broom tool (see <xref
						xlink:href="s2.ref.edit_layout" />).</para>

				<title>Button&nbsp;2 Actions</title>

				<para>When used over model elements in the the editing pane, this 
          will display a context dependent pop-up menu. Menu entries 
          are highlighted (but not selected) and sub-menus exposed by 
          subsequent mouse motion (without any buttons). Menu entry 
          selection is with button&nbsp;1 or button&nbsp;2. See 
          <xref
						xlink:href="s1.ref.edit_pane_pop_up"
					 /> for details of the 
          specific pop-up menus.</para>

				<para>In case multiple elements are selected, the pop-up menu 
          only appears if all the items are of the same kind. 
          In this case, the 
          functions apply to all selected elements.</para>

              selected datatype it displays handles 
              at the top and at the bottom 
              which may be clicked or dragged 
              to form a generalization relationship 
              (the target being another datatype).
              There are 2 other elements available here,

              These two have similar handles, 
              except the one at the top of a stereotype: 
              when clicked, it creates a metaclass, 
              connected by a dependency marked with &laquo;stereotype&raquo;.
              This eases the creation of "stereotype declaration" diagrams - 
              see the literature on the subject.

			<title>The Broom</title>

			<para>ArgoUML&#039;s broom alignment tool is specialized to 
        support the needs of designers in achieving the kind of 
        alignment used in UML diagrams. It is common for designers to 
        roughly align objects as they are created or by using simple 
        movement commands. The broom is an easy way to precisely align 
        objects that are already roughly aligned. Furthermore, the 
        broom&#039;s distribution options are suited to the needs of 
        UML designers: making related objects appear evenly spaced, 
        packing objects to save diagram space, and spreading objects 
        out to make room for new objects. The broom also makes it easy 
        to change from horizontal to vertical alignment or from 
        left-alignment to right-alignment.</para>

			<para>The T-shaped icon in ArgoUML&#039;s diagram toolbar 
        invokes the broom alignment tool. When the mouse button&nbsp;1 is 
        pressed while in broom-mode, the designer&#039;s initial mouse 
        movement orients the broom to face in one of four directions: 
        north, south, east, or west. After that, mouse drag events 
        cause the broom to advance in the chosen direction, withdraw, 
        or grow in a lateral direction. Like a real-world push broom, 
        the broom tool pushes diagram elements that come in contact 
        with it. This has the effect of aligning objects along the face 
        of the broom and provides immediate visual feedback (see the 
        figure below). Unlike a real-world broom, moving backwards 
        allows diagram elements to return to their original position. 
        Growing the broom makes it possible to align objects that are 
        not near each other. When the mouse button is released, the 
        broom disappears and the moved objects are selected to make it 
        easy to manipulate them further.</para>

			<para>If the designer presses the space bar while using the 
        broom, objects on the face of the broom are distributed (i.e., 
        spaced evenly). ArgoUML&#039;s broom supports three 
        distribution modes: objects can be spaced evenly across the 
        space that they use, objects can be packed together with only a 
        small gap between them, or objects can be distributed evenly 
        over the entire length of the broom&#039;s face. Repeatedly 
        pressing the space bar cycles among these three distribution 
        modes and displays a brief message indicating the operation 
        just performed: Space evenly, Pack tightly, Spread out and 
        Original.</para>

        12-o&#039;clock for adding a superclass, one at 6-o&#039;clock 
        for adding a subclass, and buttons at 3-o&#039;clock and 
        9-o&#039;clock for adding associations. These buttons support a 
        &quot;click or drag&quot; interaction: a single click creates a 
        new related class at a default position relative to the 
        original class and creates a generalization or association; a 
        drag from the button to an existing class creates only the 
        generalization or association; and, a drag to an empty space in 
        the diagram creates a new class at the mouse position and the 
        generalization or association. ArgoUML provides some automated 
        layout support so that clicking the subclass button will 
        position the new classes so that they do not overlap.</para>

			<para>Selection-action buttons are transparent. They have a 
        visibly recognizable rectangular shape and size and they 
        contain an icon that is the same as the icon used for the 
        corresponding type of design element on the standard toolbar. 
        However, these icons are unfilled line drawings with many 
        transparent pixels. This allows selection-action buttons to be 
        overlaid onto the drawing area without overly obscuring the 
        diagram itself. Also, the buttons are only drawn when the mouse 
        is over the selected model element; if any part of the diagram is 
        obscured, the mouse can simply be moved away to get a clearer 
        view of the diagram.</para>

			<title>Clarifiers</title>

			<para>A key feature of ArgoUML are the critics, which run in 
        parallel with the main ArgoUML tool. When they find a problem, 
        they typically raise a to-do item, and also highlight the 
        problem on the editing pane. The graphical techniques used for 
        highlighting are called <emphasis>Clarifiers</emphasis></para>

        graphical diagram or as a table. Each representation would have 
        its own tab and be selected by button&nbsp;1 click on the tab.</para>

			<para>At the top left is the icon and name of the type of 
        model element (i.e. the UML metaclass, not the actual name of this 
        particular model element). In this example the property tab is for a 
        class.</para>

			<para>To the right of this is a toolbar of icons relevant to 
        this property tab. The first one is always navigation <literal>
        Go up</literal>. The last is always <literal>Delete</literal> 
        to delete the selected model element from the model. The ones in 
        between depend on the model element.</para>

			<para>The remainder of the tab comprises fields, laid out in 
        two or three columns. Each field has a label to its left. The 
        fields may be text boxes, text areas, drop down selectors, 
        radio boxes and check boxes. In most (but not all cases) the 
        values can be changed. In the case of text boxes this is 
        sometimes by just typing the required value.</para>

			<para>However for many text boxes and text areas, data entry is 
        via a context sensitive pop-up menu (using button&nbsp;2 click), 
        which offers options to add a new entry, delete an entry or 
        move entries up and down (in text areas with multiple 
        entries).</para>

			<para>The first field is almost always a text field <literal>
        Name</literal>, where the name of the specific model element can be 
        entered. The remaining fields vary depending on the model element 
        selected.</para>

			<para>The detailed property sheets for all ArgoUML model elements 
        are discussed in separate chapters for each of the diagram 
        types (use case diagram (<xref

			<caution>

				<para>ArgoUML will always try to squeeze all fields on to the 
          property sheet. If the size of the property tab is too small, 
          it may become unusable. The solution is to either enlarge the 
          property tab by enlarging the main window, or by moving the 
          dividers to left and top.</para>

			<title>Constraints Tab</title>

			<para>Constraints are one of the extension mechanisms provided 
        for UML. ArgoUML is equipped with a powerful constraint editor 
        based on the <emphasis>Object Constraint Language 
        (OCL)</emphasis> defined in the UML&nbsp;1.4 standard.</para>

			<caution>

				<para>The OCL editor implementation for ArgoUML V0.24 
          doesn&#039;t support OCL constraints for elements other than 
          Classes and Features.</para>

				<para>This is something of a general restriction of OCL. 
          Although the UML specification claims that there may be a 
          constraint for every model element, the OCL specification 
          only defines classes/interfaces and operations as allowable 
          contexts.</para>

				<para>It is not before OCL 2.0 that a more general definition 
          of allowable contexts is introduced. The key issue is that 
          for each context definition you need to define what is the 
          contextualClassifier, i.e., the classifier that will be 
          associated with the self keyword. The creators of the OCL 
          specification claim that this is not an issue for the OCL 
          specification, but rather for UML or some integration task 
          force. Conversely, it seems that the UML specification people 
          seem to expect this to be defined in the OCL specification 
          (which is why we did a first step in that direction in OCL 
          2.0).</para>

				<para>So, to cut a long story short, it appeared that the 
          simplest solution for ArgoUML at the moment would be to 
          enable the OCL property panel only for those model elements 
          for which there actually exists a definition of the 
          contextualClassifier in OCL 1.4. These are (s. above) 
          Class/Interface and Feature.</para>

			</caution>

			<para>The standard pre-defines a small number of constraints 
        (for example the <literal>xor</literal> constraint over a set 
        of associations indicating that only one may be manifest for 
        any particular instance).</para>

			<para>The standard also envisages a number of circumstances 
        where general purpose constraints may be useful:</para>

						 />). 
            The new constraint is created with a context declaration 
            for the currently selected model element.</para>

					<warning>

						<para>It seems logical, that when a new constraint is 
              created, it needs to be edited. But ArgoUML V0.24 fails 
              to start the OCL editor upon creation; you have to do 
              this by primo selecting the new constraint first, secundo 
              rename it, and tertio press the <literal>Edit 
              Constraint</literal> button. It is essental for 
              successfully creating a constraint to follow these 4 
              steps accurately: create, select, rename, edit. The step 
              to rename is necessary, because the validity check will 
              refuse the constraint if its name differs from the name 
              mentioned in the constraint text. For the same reason, 
              renaming a constraint afterwards is impossible.</para>

			<title>Tagged Values Tab</title>

			<para>Tagged values are another extension mechanism provided by 
        UML. The user can define name-value pairs to be associated with 
        model elements which define properties of that model element. The names 
        are known as <emphasis>tags</emphasis>. UML pre-defines a 
        number of tags that are useful for many of its model elements.</para>

			<note>

				<para>The tag <literal>documentation</literal> is defined for 
          the top UML metaclass, <literal>Element</literal> and is so 
          available to all model elements. In ArgoUML documentation values 
          are provided through the <literal>Documentation</literal> 
          tab, rather than by using the <literal>
          Tagged Values</literal> tab.</para>

			</note>

			<para>The <literal>Tagged Values</literal> tab in ArgoUML 
        comprises a two column table, with a combo-box on 
        the left to select the tagdefinition
        and an editable box on the right for 
        the associated value. There is always at least one empty row 
        available for any new tag. 
        </para>

			<para>The button at the top of this tab allows creation of a new 
        tagdefinition. 
        After clicking this button, go to the properties tab first
        to set the name of the new tagdefinition. 
        <!-- Why does ArgoUML not do this? TODO: Create issue. -->

			<para>The mouse buttons have their 
        standard behavior within the editable value area (see

			<title>Checklist Tab</title>

			<para>Conducting design reviews and inspections is one of the 
        most effective ways of detecting errors during software 
        development. A design review typically consists of a small 
        number of designers, implementers, or other project 
        stakeholders holding a meeting to review a software development 
        artifact. Many development organizations have developed 
        checklists of common design problems for use in design review 
        meetings. Recent research indicated that reviewers inspecting 
        code without meeting, makeing use of these checklists, are just 
        as effective as design review meetings.</para>

			<para>Hence, a checklist feature has been added to ArgoUML, 
        that is much in the spirit of design review checklists. 
        However, ArgoUML&#039;s checklists are integrated into the 
        design tool user interface and the design task.</para>

			<para>A software designer using ArgoUML can see a review 
        checklist for any design element. The <quote>Checklist</quote> 
        tab presents a list of check-off items that is appropriate to 
        the currently selected design element. For example, when a 
        class is selected in a design diagram, the checklist tab shows 
        items that prompt critical thinking about classes. See the 
        figure below. Designers may check off items as they consider 
        them. Checked items are kept in the list to show what has 
        already been considered, while unchecked items prompt the 
        designer to consider new design issues. ArgoUML supplies many 
        different checklists with many possible items.</para>

		<section>

			<title>Introduction</title>

			<para>The key feature that distinguishes ArgoUML from other UML 
        CASE tools is its use of concepts from cognitive psychology. 
        The theory behind this is well described in Jason Robbins&#039; 
        PhD dissertation 
        <link
					xlink:href="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/"
					>
        http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</link>.</para>

			<para>Critics are one of the main ways in which these ideas are 
        implemented. Running in the background they offer advice to the 
        designer which may be accepted or ignored. A key point is that 
        they do not <emphasis>impose</emphasis> a decision on the 
        designer.</para>

			<note>

				<para>The critics are asynchronous processes that run in 
          parallel with the main ArgoUML tool. Changes typically take a 
          second or two to propagate as the critics wake up.</para>

			</note>

			<section>

				<title>Terminology</title>

				<para>The <emphasis>critics</emphasis> are background 
          processes, which evaluate the current model according to 
          various <quote>good</quote> design criteria. There is one 
          critic for every design criterion.</para>

				<para>The output of a critic is a 
          <emphasis>critique</emphasis>&#8212;a statement about some aspect 
          of the model that does not appear to follow good design 
          practice.</para>

				<para>Finally a critique will generally suggest how the bad 
          design issue it has identified can be rectified, by raising a 
          <emphasis>to-do item</emphasis>.</para>

				<title>Design Issues</title>

				<para>ArgoUML categorizes critics according the the design 
          issue they address (some critics may be in more than one

			<para>ArgoUML has the following critics in this category.</para>

			<section xml:id="critics.CrNonAggDataType">

				<title>Wrap DataType</title>

				<para>DataTypes are not full classes within UML 1.4. They can 
          only have enumeration literals as values, and only support 
          <literal>query</literal> operations (that is operations that 
          do not change the DataType&#039;s state).</para>

				<para>DataTypes cannot be associated with classes, unless the 
          DataType is part of a composite (black diamond) aggregation. 
          Such an association relects the tight binding of a collection 
          of DataType instances to a class instance. In effect such a 
          DataType is an attribute of the class with 
          multiplicity.</para>

				<para>Good OOA&amp;D depends on careful choices about which 
          entities to represent as full objects and which to represent 
          as attributes of objects.</para>

				<itemizedlist>

						<para>Replace the DataType with a full class.</para>

				<title>Reduce Classes in namespace &lt;namespace&gt;</title>

				<para>Suggestion to improve understandability by having fewer 
          classes in one namespace. If one namespace 
          (such as the model, a package, or a class) 
          has too many classes
          it may become very difficult for humans to 
          understand. Defining an understandable set of

					<para>This number is not stored persistently, and
            there is no way to reduce it after it has been set higher,

				<title>Change Names or Signatures in a model element</title>

				<para>Two operations in &lt;model element&gt; have the same 
          signature. This means their name is the same, and the list of 
          parameters has the same type.</para>

				<para>Where there are conflicting signatures, correct code

				<para>Only if these all match in both type and order, will

				<para>This follows the line of Java/C++ in ignoring the

          <emphasis>may</emphasis> be unsatisfactory for some 
          functional OO languages.</para>

				<note>

					<para>Some purists would argue that the comparison should

				<para>The <emphasis>class</emphasis> has no non-static 
          attributes nor any associations that are navigable away from

          there will be nothing about the instances that can 
          differentiate them.</para>

				<para>Under these circumstances you should consider making 
          explicit that you have exactly one instance of this class, by 
          using the singleton Pattern. Using the singleton pattern can 
          save time and memory space. Within ArgoUML this can be done 
          by using the &laquo;singleton&raquo; stereotype on this class.</para>

				<para>If it is not your intent to have a single instance, you

				<para>Having specified <emphasis>class</emphasis> as a 
          singleton, you need to define the class so there can only be 
          a single instance. This will complete the information 
          representation part of your design. To achieve this you need 
          to do the following.</para>

				<orderedlist>

					<listitem>

						<para>You must define a static attribute (a class 
              variable) holding the instance. This must therefore have 
              <emphasis>class</emphasis> as its type.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>You must have only private constructors so that new 
              instances cannot be made by other code. The creation of 
              the single instance could be through a suitable helper 
              operation, which invokes this private constructor just 
              once.</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>You must have at least one constructor to override

          a singleton). A singleton class can have at most one 
          instance. This means that the class must meet the design 
          criteria for a singleton (see 
          <xref

				<para>Whenever you mark a class with a stereotype, the class 
          should satisfy all constraints of the stereotype. This is an

				<para>Associations involving an interface can be not be

				<title>Classifier not in Namespace of its Association</title>

				<para>One of the well-formedness rules in UML 1.4 for

          which each end could refer to all the others.</para>

				<para>This critic is triggered when an association does not

				<caution>

					<para>In the current implementation of ArgoUML this critic

				<title>Two Aggregate Ends (Roles) in Binary

				<para>Only one end (role) of a binary association can be 
          aggregate or composite. This a well-formedness rule of the 
          UML 1.4 standard.</para>

				<para>Aggregation and composition are used to indicate 
          whole-part relationships, and by definition, the 
          <quote>part</quote> end cannot be aggregate.</para>

				<para>To fix this, identify the <quote>part</quote> end of 
          the association, and use the critic wizard (the <literal>
          Next&gt;</literal> button, or manually set its aggregation to 
          <literal>none</literal> using the button&nbsp;2 pop-up menu or the 
          property sheet.</para>

				<para>Composition (more correctly called composite 
          aggregation) is used where there is a whole-part relationship 
          that is one-to-one or one-to-many, and the lifetime of the 
          part is inextricably tied to the lifetime of the whole. 
          Instances of the whole will have responsibility for creating 
          and destroying instances of the associated part. This also 
          means that a class can only be a part in one composite 
          aggregation.</para>

				<para>An example of a composite aggregation might be a 
          database of cars and their wheels. This is a one-to-four 
          relationship, and the database entry for a wheel is 
          associated with its car. When the car ceases to exist in the 
          database, so do its wheels.</para>

				<para>Aggregation (more correctly called shared aggregation) 
          is used where there is a whole-part relationship, that does 
          not meet the criteria for a composite aggregation. An example 
          might be a database of university courses and the students 
          that attend them. There is a whole-part relationship between 
          courses and students. However there is no lifetime 
          relationship between students and course (a student continues 
          to exist even after a course is finished) and the 
          relationship is many-to-many.</para>
