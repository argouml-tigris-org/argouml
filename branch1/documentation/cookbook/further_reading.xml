    <para>Cognitive Support Features for Software Development Tools </para>
    <para>The dissertation of Jason Robbins is a <emphasis>MUST READ</emphasis> for everyone concerned about ArgoUML. Be careful though, since it is based on an old version of ArgoUML, but many of the concepts remain intact. </para>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <para>Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Most software design tools provide support for editing, viewing, storing, sharing, and transforming designs, but lack support for the essential and difficult cognitive tasks facing designers. These cognitive tasks include decision making, decision ordering, and task-specific design understanding. To date, software design tools have not included features that specifically address key cognitive needs of designers, in part, because there has been no practical method for developing and evaluating these features. </para>
      <para>This dissertation contributes a practical description of several cognitive theories relevant to software design, a method for devising cognitive support features based on these theories, a basket of cognitive support features that are demonstrated in the context of a usable software design tool called ArgoUML, and a reusable infrastructure for building similar features into other design tools. ArgoUML is an object-oriented design tool that includes several novel features that address the identified cognitive needs of software designers. Each feature is explained with respect to the cognitive theories that inspired it and the set of features is evaluated with a combination of heuristic and empirical techniques. </para>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <para xml:lang="de" > Noch vor der Erstellung eines detaillierten Entwurfs hilft ein Spezifikationsmodell eines komponenten-basierten Systems dabei, Probleme so fr�h im Entwicklungsprozess wie m�glich zu entdecken. Die Sprache CCL ('Component Constraint Language') wurde bei CIS entwickelt und erlaubt den Entwickler 'Contextbased Constraints' dem Spezifikationsmodell hinzuzuf�gen. Dadurch entsteht ein Modell, das �ber die Beschreibung der statische Struktur des Systems hinausgeht. Zur Zeit existiert allerdings kein Werkzeug, dass das Komponentenspezifikationsmodell in den Entwicklungsprozess integriert. Ziel dieser Diplomarbeit war der Entwurf eines solchen Werkzeugs, um die Philosophie des Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) zu unterst�tzten. </para>
      <para>Before starting a detailed design, a specification model of the component-based system assists the software developer in early problem detection as soon as possible in the development process. The Component Constraint Language (CCL) developed at CIS enables the developer to add context-based constraints (CoCons) to a component specification model. This produces a model which goes beyond the simple description of the system's static structure. At this time, there is no tool to integrate the component specification model into the development process. The goal of this master's thesis was to design such a tool, thereby supporting the Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) philosophy. </para>
