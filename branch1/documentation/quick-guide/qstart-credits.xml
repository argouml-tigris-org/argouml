    This is a documentation template for a chapter in the ArgoUML manual.
    It was designed by Kunle Odutola for use in the ArgoUML ducumentation
    effort. Please use the template as the basis for writing additional 
    chapters for the manual. 
    All the words written in UPPERCASE are placeholders and should be replaced.
    Please not that _id_ must be unique wihin the entire ArgoUML DocBook manual 
    document so, you are encouraged to prefix all subsequent _id_ with the
    chapter id thus:
    If CHAPTER-ID is "installation", you may then have "installation-windows",
    "installation-system" etc...
    
    Please remember that this is only a template and you are free to deviate
    from it where there is a benefit to doing so. In this event please post 
    your ideas to the ArgoUML mailing list and I may update this template with 
    your idea.
    
    Please help to keep the ArgoUML manual logical and readable. And don't forget 
    to remove these comments from the final documentation!  ;-)
