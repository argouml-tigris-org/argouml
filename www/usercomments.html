Användning av ArgoUML i undervisningen. Ja, du får gärna använda citatet. Vi
kommer att proköra ArgoUML i en grundkurs i OO på distans i stället för Rose
eller Together, som vi använder för campuskurser, dels för att det är gratis
och därmed får användas av vem som helst, dels för att det inte är för stort
att ladda hem, dels för att det gick smärtfritt att installera. Jag har
tittat en del på det och tror att det räcker åtminstone för kursens nivå.

By the way, as far as I can see, you guys have done a great job with
ArgoUML. It is currently under investigation at the department to be the
recommended design tool for a course in object-oriented
programming. Keep up
the good work.

With Pleasure
My company is ARC

TMX Time and Dimensional Reality
technology development program
http//tmx2.swiki.net

Within half an hour I had created
the enclosed diagram which got this comment

 >Wot a LUVELY diagram, dear :-)

form one of our members (Desiree)

:-)

I also downloaded the Poseidon Community edition
and was very impressed with this too (Ease of use and presentation)

It is our policy to support freeware and so we will stay with ArgoUML

I came across
ArgoUML (18 meg download)
(I have been after a diagram builder/planner for some time)

which may be of interest
you will need a java VM to run it

This Software is (in part)
a diagram creator - like VIO

It is written in Java
- Very few freeware programs (rather than applets)
available in this format (that I have come across)

http://argouml.tigris.org
(it can output XML)
I feel it is quite an advanced tool
Expect to put in a little work to understand it
Now is your chance to get a java prog working
(just started and created a nice little diagram - output to gif)

my old marine buddy
Poseidon has a community edition that is based on the ArgoUML
it is better looking and easier than ArgoUML
but it had a very peculiar sign up procedure
and was slower than ArgoUML
so I am sticking with ArgoUML
(usual apologies to King Neptune/Poseidon)

=============
-->
It is rare to find good software,
rare to find it written in java for Linux, Windows and all OS,
rare to find it is free.
<p>
What a joy to come across
ArgoUML.
<p>
I will be promoting your efforts wherever
I travel on the Net and elsewhere
<p>
Thank you for your excellent efforts and achievements.
You and your friends are welcome on HolyGeek
anytime :-)

Hi Linus,

> Can I use your name, your company name, and this statement (first two
> sentences) on a "ArgoUML kudos" or "ArgoUML user comments"-web page?

The problem is that this was a privat request, so i think
my company is not happy if the name COMPANY is used. You can use - of
course - my name (excect the email-adress and the name COMPANY)
in the statements. 

I'm sorry that i can't support more and thanks a lot to
ask for that.



Best Reguards,


Carsten

I have found ArgoUML at sourceforge and must say that
this is realy smart. I am one of those developers who
has written software years before UML coming up, so
I dont have any experince with it.

I recently started to use ArgoUML as my UML tool of choice ... :-)
and a very nice one at that...
