<H1>ArgoUML in Google's Summer Of Code 2007</H1>

<p>
The ArgoUML project is approved for participation in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>
during 2007.
</p>

<p>
This page include a list of project suggestions and
some general tips on what we look for in a student such as
<a href="#look_for_students">what we look for in a student</a>,
<a href="#look_for_projects">what projects we are looking for</a>, and
<a href="#project_intro_references">some quick references on the projects</a>.
<!--
and
<a href="#application">how you should fill in your applications</a>.

<h2>The suggested list of projects</h2>
<p>
Don't let this list limit your choices.
We are happy to consider other projects!
See the 
<a href="#looked_for_projects">general notes on what projects we are
looking for</a>.

<h3>Improve the Sequence Diagrams</h3>
<p>
The sequence diagrams in ArgoUML are in need of some work.
</p>

<p>
What we would like is sequence diagrams that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Work well for common shores</li>
    <li>Allow conversion to/from collaboration diagrams</li>
    <li>Are connected to reverse engineering/code generation</li>
    <li>...?</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Handling of UML Profiles</h3>
<p>
UML Profiles is the foundation for extending UML.
There is initiatives to formalize their definition,
there are profiles that are implemented in other tools without
a formal definition.
</p>

<p>
What we would like is code that allows ArgoUML to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>load UML profiles and apply them to the work.</li>
    <li>include the most important existing UML profiles (SysML, BPM, ...).</li>
  </ul>
<p>This may be one or two projects.
</p>

<h3>Create "Critics" for all UML well-formedness rules</h3>
<p>
Critics are ArgoUML's system of warnings, 
i.e. when you break a rule of UML, then a warning will be generated,
much like warnings and errors used for source code correctness and style.
</p>
<p>
The UML contains the so-called "Well-formedness rules" (WFR),
written in OCL,
which specify constraints to the creation of model-elements.
</p>
<p>
ArgoUML currently contains an outdated set of critics, 
from the days we supported UML 1.3. 
These need to be updated to the UML 1.4 standard, and completed. 
</p>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Improve a subsystem of your choice by solving existing issues</h3>
<p>
The issues database contains many <i>bugs</i> 
and <i>enhancement requests</i>.
Go to the query page at 
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi?">Issue tracking query</a>,
and select a subsystem from the list below.
</p>
<p>
The task for the student is to solve 
as much of these issues 
within one subsystem
as (s)he can.
</p>

<p> These are acceptable subsystems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Class Diagram</li>
	<li>CodeGeneration and ReverseEngineering</li>
	<li>Collaboration Diagram</li>
	<li>Cpp module</li>
	<li>Critics</li>
	<li>Csharp module</li>
	<li>Deployment Diagram</li>
	<li>Diagrams</li>
	<li>Explorer</li>
	<li>GUI</li>
	<li>Model</li>
	<li>Model/MDR</li>
	<li>Module loader</li>
	<li>Notation</li>
	<li>OCL and Constraints</li>
	<li>Other</li>
	<li>Persistence</li>
	<li>PHP module</li>
	<li>Property Panels</li>
	<li>Sequence Diagram</li>
	<li>State and Activity Diagram</li>
	<li>Usecase Diagram</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beware: This may seem less interesting than
adding one big new feature to ArgoUML, 
but has the big advantage that 
the work is broken in many small parts, 
each of which are usefull to solve on its own.
No pressure for deadlines, 
no disappointment if a project remains unfinished!

<a name="look_for_students"><h2>The students we are looking for</h2></a>

<p>
We are looking for enthusiastic students with a solid knowledge of Java,
who are interested in software development tools and modeling,
particularly the UML modeling language.
Most, although not all, tasks will be easier for those who already
have an working knowledge of the OMG's UML.

<a name="look_for_projects"><h2>The projects we are looking for</h2></a>
<p>
This page include a list of suggested projects that the development team
has thought of, but we are happy to consider projects which are
not listed here.

If you'd like to suggest a different project,
please discuss it previously with the team on the developers' mailing list
so that you can develop the strongest possible proposal for
evaluation. 

There's also a more general list of development tasks which
have been suggested over time available in our 
<a href="jobjar.html">Job Jar</a> which may offer additional sources of
inspiration
and our bug database could be another source of inspiration.
