This FAQ is provided with the hopes to be helpful for users using
ArgoUML or Poseidon for their projects.
</p><p>
It is a collection of tips and tricks from the mailing lists and
from other persons that have made experiences using ArgoUML that
they want to share for the benefit of the community. It is by no means
a complete overview but does rather reflect the interest and problems
that the users have.
</p><p>
The information is updated as the questions and answers becomes
appearant to the FAQ moderator. A certain version of the FAQ is
only loosely connected to a specific version of ArgoUML or Poseidon
but can rather elaborate on how a problem is solved differently in the
different versions.

Any information that is exactly the same as in the last frosen version
of the Users' manual. If it is in the manual, the answer does not need
to be in the FAQ also. The FAQ might still contain the question but the
answer is merely a reference.

Introduction</h2></div></div><div class="qandaset"><dl><dt>2.1 <a href="#Na52">Introduction</a></dt><dd><dl><dt> <a href="#Na59">What is Argo?</a></dt></dl></dd></dl><div class="qandadiv"><h3 class="title"><a name="Na52">2.1 Introduction</a></h3><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Na59"></a><b> </b>What is Argo?</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Na5f"></a><b> </b>Argo UML is Java based Universal Modeling Language tool. It is able to create and save most of the nine UML diagrams without problem. It has the ability to reverse engineer compiling java .class code and generate UML diagrams for it. Output features are available but the save component of Argo has known problems.  </p><p>But that's not to say that it is also one of the most powerful UML tool under ?which? Open Source License.</p><p>It's also one of the better supported OS projects!</p><p>Argo UML is in full sail! </p><p> That is to say Argo has not locked up on me once!</p><p>The waters are choppy in places (nasty currents in the Save waters), unpredictable winds (Will it open old documents? Will I be able to reuse the software maps I've already created?).</p><p>The navigation charts are set with  DocBook XML. Together we'll get Argo from the development port to the production port! </p><p>Understandably when you get into a boat you plan on going somewhere. But don't plan on a cross Atlantic trip with Argo, it's more appropriate for a lake cruise in calm weather.</p><p>Argo is NOT production ready! Meaning you will get distracted by the things you can't do and you'll feel like your drowning sometimes if you've used commercial UML tools. But, hey, Argo started as an academic project, not a commercial project. And, it's free, the potential is there, that's clear, because you are here...</p><p>All open source projects are as useful and helpful as the users and developers identify and implement use cases, code, correct misunderstandings, identify bugs, and help with the documentation!</p><p>We need your help and here's how.</p><p>Use it!</p><p>We've made it easy to get and to use! Use the Java Web Start (JWS)Version ! This will give you the latest "stable" build. Version .8.1 is officially supported by the developers, but give the JWS version a try! </p><p>Technically, the latest version of Argo can Reverse Engineer compiling Java code...which means we will soon have all of the classes of Argo in UML form! That'll help everyone to better understand and advance the code and, most importantly...usability!</p><p>We'll help you along the way too! Please specify your Argo version and your OS when making your requests for help. </p><p>Try to get into the habit of modeling your questions using UML! It'll help you learn the ins and outs of UML and it'll give the developers and the users a better idea of how to use Argo, what does and does not work AND for budding developers a chance to model real code! </p><p>If you're comfortable coding, jump into the developer's galley and build Argo from the inside out with the CVS. The CVS has functionality's that have not been deemed ready for JWS release yet. Give it a try! You'll find some tips on using the CVS in this user document.</p><p>Want more?</p><p>Reverse engineer the use case and activity diagrams of the usage of Argo. Do this using Argo! </p><p> Then, model the Use cases you would like to see implemented in Argo! Model the activities, the classes, the states, the activities. Then re-engineer Argo itself and see how your model of a UML tool compares to Argo! </p><p>We're sure that at no matter your UML skills working through the reverse engineering process will be satisfying.</p><p>At this point you will have mastered the very sophisticated mapping of programming and problem solving. And you will have learned a number of highly valued skills in program analysis, business case analysis, and communication analysis. In fact you will have learned how to communicate some of the most sophisticated ideas in a way that anyone with a little training can understand. </p><p>Save your diagrams as .zArgo! And mail them to the user group as attachments! This will help all of us by building a library of UML diagrams for reference and for development purposes!</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="chapter" id="Naab"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="Naab"></a>Chapter 3.

Do Argo and Poseidon save .xmi files?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Ncfe"></a><b> </b>
Yes. They save the model information in an .xmi-file, the diagram
information in a .pgml-file and information about the project in a .Argo
file. All of these are
then
zipped  to a .zArgo-file. You can easily extract the .xmi from the
.zArgo file
using any old generic ZIP application. Give it a try and look into the
magic of Argo.
Be aware that double clicking will launch a ZIP utility, if one is
installed, and NOT Argo.
</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nd07"></a><b> </b>
How do I import an .xmi into Argo and what formats are known to be
supported?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nd0d"></a><b> </b>
Because of the variety of .xmi formats being generated you will
encounter problems using other .xmis generated from other applications.
ArgoUML's native storage format is another implementation of XMI (Curt
Arnold believes that it has been hacked so it can also read the Unisys
variant).  He recommends that if you are comfortable with XSLT, you can
typically transform one variant of UML + XMI to another, plus
MetaIntegrations (http://www.metaintegrations.net) makes a version of
their Bridge product available to transform between XMI flavors.

How can I print my diagrams?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nd1c"></a><b> </b>
Select a diagram, then go to File-&gt;Export Diagrams. You can generate
gif, postscript, eps or .svg format.
</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nd25"></a><b> </b>
What does SVG stand for?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nd2b"></a><b> </b>
A super cool vector graphics format (like MM Flash) that is totally open
and is gaining enormous ground in the graphics world. Find out more at
the www.W3C.org. </p><p>As well visit Adobe.com for the plugin for NN and IE</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nd37"></a><b> </b> How do I save my diagrams as .SVG?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nd3d"></a><b> </b>First: select .svg as the file type. Second: type the name of the file as you like with the .svg tag at the end. Example myumldiagram.svg</p><p>Argo does not do it automatically. See the to-do list.</p><p> Et viola! SVG! Give it a try and zoom around a little...They are not pretty though, so if you know anything about rendering beautiful SVG let us know!</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you'll need a browser that can read SVG, the plugin for NN and IE are available at Adobe.com</p><p>There are a few browsers that read SVG natively: Amaya, X-Smiles, and a rudimentary version of Mozilla.</p><p></p><p>See to do list</p><p>Be aware: You will not have scroll bars for your SVG unless it is embedded into an HTML! Good luck and let us know what you find!

You can help by joining the ArgoUML project.
</p><p>
On the 
<a href="http://www.argouml.org/" target="_top">ArgoUML web site</a>
there is a list of things to do in Issues.
</p><p>
The project needs persons skilled in several different fields such as:
