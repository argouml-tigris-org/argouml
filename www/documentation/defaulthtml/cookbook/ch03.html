This chapter contains a description on how ArgoUML should work
and behave for the users.
</p><p>
These things might not be implemented yet and the solutions
might not even be clear but it is a definition of the goal.
</p><p>
The fact that it is not implemented or doesn't work as stated here
should be registered as a bug 
in the bug registering tool.
</p><p>
Every requirement has
a number (REQ1, REQ2, REQ3, ...) that never changes,
a revision (REV1, REV2, REV3, ...) that changes when the requirement change,
a text that is the requirement text to implement,
a rationale that is the description on why this is important,
a stakeholder that is one of the stakeholders in the vision for who
this is important.

This describes how the ArgoUML look and feel shall behave.
</p><p>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="REQ1"></a>
When multiple visual components are showing the same model element
they shall be updated in a consistent manner throughout the application.
</p><p>
REQ1 REV1
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
There is no way of telling where the user is looking while working with
ArgoUML.
For this reason he might be terribly confused if some other view that
happens to show the same element is not showing the same thing.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Stakeholder:</em></span>
User of ArgoUML
</p></li><li><p><a name="REQ2"></a>
As soon as the model element changes then all views shall update.
For text fields, this can be at every key stroke.
</p><p>
REQ2 REV1
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
If a user makes an update of a part of the model,
an immediate feedback in all other parts that are currently showing
might help him to get it right.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Stakeholder:</em></span>
User of ArgoUML
</p></li><li><p><a name="REQ3"></a>
There shall be no indication of an exception on the screen or in the
log if it has occured merely because of a user mistyping or not being
aware of UML syntax.
</p><p>
REQ3 REV1
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
An exception in the log or on the screen is always the sign of a serious
error in the application that should be reported as a DEFECT.
If a mistyping generates such a problem the user might loose interest in
ArgoUML as a tool because he percieves it as not working correctly.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Stakeholder:</em></span>
User of ArgoUML
</p></li><li><p><a name="REQ4"></a>
All text fields shall have context sensitive help.
</p><p>
As follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>
A tooltip that explains the data and format expected by the
particular field.
</p><p>
This can be omitted when there is a header stating the data of
the field and the format is obvious.
</p></li><li><p>
Pressing F1 or choosing help from the menu shall display a popup
window explaining for data and format required by the current input
field. 
Input focus shall be left on the field during any user
interaction with the popup (dragging, scrolling or closing).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
REQ4 REV1
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
Throughout a complex application like ArgoUML there are lots of text fields.
Unless there is a possibility to always get this kind of help 
the user might not be able to make out 
what he is actually supposed to do in that field.
