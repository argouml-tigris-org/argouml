This chapter contains a description on how ArgoUML should work
and behave for the users.
</p><p>
These things might not be implemented yet and the solutions
might not even be clear but it is a definition of the goal.
</p><p>
The fact that it is not implemented or doesn't work as stated here
should be registered as a bug 
in the bug registering tool.
</p><p>
Every requirement has
a number (REQ1, REQ2, REQ3, ...) that never changes,
a revision (REVa, REVb, REVc, ...) that changes when the requirement change,
a text that is the requirement text to implement,
a rationale that is the description on why this is important,
a stakeholder that is one of the stakeholders in the vision for who
this is important.

</h3></div></div></div><p>
REQ1 REVa
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
There is no way of telling where the user is looking while working with
ArgoUML.
For this reason he might be terribly confused if some other view that
happens to show the same element is not showing the same thing.
</p><p>

REQ2 REVb
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
If a user makes an update of a part of the model,
an immediate feedback in all other parts that are currently showing
might help him to get it right.

Any text fields that require validation

</h3></div></div></div><p>
REQ12 REVa
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
If a text field requires validation there exists, by definition,
a possibility that the text field is in an invalid state
at any time during editing.
Therefore the model cannot be updated until the field is completed 
in a valid state or rejected.

With dialogs, the model is not updated until the dialog

</h3></div></div></div><p>
REQ13 REVa
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
It is a common feature of GUIs that a dialog displays
a snapshot of its model at the time of creation and
only updates that model on the user acceptance of the entire dialog.
This is a familiar look and feel for users.

The user shall receive some visual feedback during

</h3></div></div></div><p>
REQ14 REVa
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
Writing a correct syntax of anything is complicated.
Good compilers are helpful in pinpointing where the problem is
(what line and what token is in error).
The text fields in ArgoUML are
not developed in the same way as source code and
we have no compiler step to verify it all.
Instead this validation needs to be done while editing meaning that
the user needs all the help he can get to as quickly as possible,
get the syntax right.

There shall be no indication of an exception on the screen or in the
log if it has occured merely because of a user mistyping or not being
aware of UML syntax.
</h3></div></div></div><p>
REQ3 REVa
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
An exception in the log or on the screen is always the sign of a serious
error in the application that should be reported as a DEFECT.
If a mistyping generates such a problem the user might loose interest in
ArgoUML as a tool because he percieves it as not working correctly.

User of ArgoUML
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="REQ4"></a>3.1.8.&nbsp;
All text fields shall have context sensitive help.
</h3></div></div></div><p>
As follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A tooltip that explains the data and format expected by the
particular field.
</p><p>
This can be omitted when there is a header stating the data of
the field and the format is obvious.
</p></li><li><p>
Pressing F1 or choosing help from the menu shall display a popup
window explaining for data and format required by the current input
field. 
Input focus shall be left on the field during any user
interaction with the popup (dragging, scrolling or closing).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
REQ4 REVa
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Rationale:</em></span>
Throughout a complex application like ArgoUML there are lots of text fields.
Unless there is a possibility to always get this kind of help 
the user might not be able to make out 
what he is actually supposed to do in that field.
