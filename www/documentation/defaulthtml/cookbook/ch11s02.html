This can be performed by persons that has the Developer role 
in the project.
Persons without the Developer role can do most of the work but they
need a person with the the role to actually commit the work.
There might be special skills involved but it differs widely depending
on the nature of the Issue.
</p><p>
Do the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="resolve_issue_start"></a>
Pick any Issue that is NEW or REOPENED
that you from the description think that you are able to solve.
Best result if you also find some Issue that you really feel 
needs to be solved.
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=argouml&amp;issue_status=NEW&amp;issue_status=REOPENED" target="_top">The list of all of them</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Look at your personal schedule and how much time you have during the
next couple of weeks and compare that to the amount of time you think
you will need to spend, solving the issue.
Compare this to the release plan to see what release your contribution
will fit in.
</p></li><li><p>
Accept the Issue (setting it to Status STARTED), 
setting Target Milestone to the release you have
chosen.
</p></li><li><p>
Make sure you have a checked out copy of ArgoUML or else check out 
a new one.
</p><p>
How this is done is described in
<a href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building from source">Chapter 2</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Change the code to solve the problem.
</p></li><li><p>
Compile and test your new code.
</p><p>
Optionally this could include developing a JUnit test case to
verify that the problem is solved.
You could also develop the JUnit test case before actually solving
the problem.
</p><p>
If your solution did not work as intended, continue changing it
until it does.
</p><p>
If you feel that your estimation of the complexity of the problem
and your own abilities and time available was incorrect,
then change the Target Milestone of the Issue to another one
that fits your new estimation.
This is just a change of plan.
</p><p>
If you, at this point, feel that your personal plans have changed
so that you won't have time to pursue the work,
change the Issue back to "NEW" with your experiences sofar
stated in the comment. Remember not to commit your changes.
This means that you are giving up and giving the Issue back to
anyone.
</p></li><li><p>
Commit your changes (and the JUnit test case if any) stating
the number of the Issue in the comment.
</p></li><li><p>
"Resolve" the Issue with the resolution "FIXED".
</p></li><li><p>
Sit back and feel the personal satisfaction of having completed a
something that will be part of the ArgoUML product.
</p></li><li><p>
If you during this, have discovered other problems,
create new Issues stating those new problems
according to the rule for creating Issues.
