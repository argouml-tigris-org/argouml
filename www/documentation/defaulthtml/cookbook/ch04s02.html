Each component that is used by other components provide
two ways for other components to use them:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Facade class
</p><p>
The use of Facade class is not wide spread in ArgoUML.
This is because ArgoUML is traditionally built as a whole
and no components were clearly defined.
</p><p>
A Facade class provides the most common functions other components
want to do when using that components to reduce the need of having
to use anything else but the Facade class.
The Facade class should be very much more stable than the component
itself.
Methods in the Facade should change really slowly and only be 
removed after several months (and one stable release) of deprecation.
</p><p>
The Facade class is documented in the class file itself (as javadoc)
and the more complex picture (if needed) is documented in the
Cookbook (in <a href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Inside the components">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Inside the components</i></a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Calls to public methods
</p><p>
Traditionally components interface through public methods and
public variables.
For this reason, always exercise extreme caution when changing
the signature of a public method. 
(See <a href="ch08.html#groundrules" title="8.1.&nbsp;How to work against the CVS repository">Section&nbsp;8.1, &#8220;How to work against the CVS repository&#8221;</a>.)
</p><p>
This way of communicating is still to be used when it is not
convenient to use the Facade for a specific use of that component.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For each component X in ArgoUML that uses the component Y 
the designer of that component X, 
must decide if he wants to use calls to public methods
when using the component Y 
(putting a set of import org.argouml.Y.internals.blabla.*; statements
in each file in the files of component X that uses component Y)
or just use the Facade class of component Y
(putting only one import org.argouml.Y.YFacade; 
in each file in the component X that uses component Y).
</p><p>
The public calls solution 
makes the component X depending on the component Y meaning
that when we change the insides of the component Y we must also change
component X.
The facade calls solution
doesn't make the component X depending on the component Y
but just the Facade of component Y.
</p><p>
If the public calls solution or facade calls solution is used
shall be described in the Cookbook's description of component X
in the list of used components.
