All titles of chapters, sections etc. are capitalized throughout.
</p></li><li><p>
All titles of figures, tables etc. have the first word only capitalized.
</p></li><li><p>
Spelling is US English.
(According to The Webster's Second Unabridged.)
</p></li><li><p>
Use full URLs throughout all documents!
Rationale: 
These documents may also be published in other formats then 
html on the ArgoUML web site.
</p></li><li><p>
Do not include lists of what changes have been done to the files.
This information is kept by CVS, the version control tool.
This is changed since Jeremy Bennet did the work for 
the 0.9/0.10 User Manual and there might still exist such lists.
Remove them while changing the files!
</p><p>
The Cookbook has a Change Log 
(See <a href="pr01.html" title="Change Log">Change Log</a>)
that is updated for every significant
change but that is for the purpose of making it easier for the readers.
</p></li><li><p>
When problems in the current implementation of ArgoUML are mentioned
or perhaps even emphasized using the
<tt class="sgmltag-element">warning</tt> tag,
include the issue number in a sgml-comment in the source 
so that it is easy to know if this problem has been fixed
when revising the document.
The issue should be mentioned in the format &#8220;<span class="quote">issue xxx</span>&#8221;, i.e.
there should only be a space between 
the word &#8220;<span class="quote">issue</span>&#8221; 
and the issue number. 
This allows the tigris web site to 
generate links when viewing
the manual source.
</p></li><li><p>
Do not write "currently". Better write either
"in version 0.14" if you mean in the stable version 0.14 of ArgoUML or "in
version &amp;argoversion;" if you mean in the current version of the document
as defined in <tt class="filename">default.properties</tt> when 
the document is deployed.
There
are some old references to "current" or "currently" also. If you encounter
them, try to remove them!
        </p></li><li><p>
For documents that contain an &#8220;<span class="quote">index</span>&#8221;,
Add indexterms while doing changes. 
Creating the index is a good idea 
and we eventually should have indexterms all over. 
Initially, the manual was written without
useing indexterms at all. 
They have been added 
generously on certain parts but that makes the index
strangely biased.
        </p><p>
Capitalize the part of the indexterms that are terms.
</p><p>
Don't use the tertiary level of the index terms but 
use only two alternatives:
Only primary, and primary/secondary.
If you are unsure when to use primary or primary/secondary use
the small word approach.
I.e. if the indexterm contains a small word (typically to, of, for, in)
and normally not capitalized, let the secondary start with that
small word.
</p><p>
When using primary/secondary, see that you get the same kind of
word as used before in the index (especially when it comes to
differences in singular/plural-form).
Also create other indexterm by turning the phrase to as many
permutations that you can think of.
