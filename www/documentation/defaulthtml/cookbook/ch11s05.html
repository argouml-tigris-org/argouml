This can be performed by any member of the project (any role).
There might be special skills involved but it differs widely depending
on the nature of the Issue.
</p><p>
Do the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="verify_resolved_fixed_start"></a>
Pick any Issue that is RESOLVED/FIXED or WORKSFORME and that you have
not raised, nor solved and that is included in a release
(Target milestone set to a release available on the site).
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=argouml&amp;issue_status=RESOLVED&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;resolution=WORKSFORME" target="_top">The list of all RESOLVED/FIXED and RESOLVED/WORKSFORME issues</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Run the specified release of ArgoUML.
You can also use any later release.
Use ArgoUML provided for downloads or 
through Java Web Start.
</p></li><li><p>
Test the problem in the issue and verify that the problem is no longer
there or the feature is provided.
</p></li><li><p>
Do one of the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
If the problem is gone, the feature is present put the Issue in
Status VERIFIED and
add the version of the ArgoUML used for the test in in the comment.
              </p><p> Remark: As an additional activity, the 
                verifier may check if the manual needs to be adapted, and if 
                so, may REOPEN the issue with an explanation text, and setting 
                the correct subcomponent (Documentation &amp; Help). </p></li><li><p>
If the problem is still there, the feature does not work, put the
Issue in Status REOPENED with a description of what is still there, is
still missing.
Also state what version of ArgoUML used for the test in the comment.
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>
If you during this, have discovered other problems than the one
stated in the Issue, create new Issues for those new problems
according to the rule for creating Issues.
</p></li><li><p>
Do this as many times as you like until there are no Issues left.
