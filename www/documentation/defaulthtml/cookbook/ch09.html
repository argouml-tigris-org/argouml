breaking it out into its own private commented method.

Checkstyle ignores three kinds of lines in this check because of the
historical use of long class names and package names.
These are lines that contain
"//&nbsp;$Id$",
import statements, and
Javadoc comments with @see-tags.

</p></li><li><p>
Use deprecation when removing public and protected
classes, 
methods and
attributes.
</p><p>
Whenever you have a public or protected method or attribute in a class or
a public class 
that you want to 
remove,
change the signature in an incompatible way, or 
make change visibility for
you shall always deprecate it first.
After the next stable release you (or someone else) can remove it.
</p><p>
In the future, when the subsystems are well defined and it is clear
what public or protected 
methods, attributes or classes 
that are part of a certain subsystem's
exported interface 
we can allow an exception to this rule for 
methods, attributes and classes 
that are not.
(See <a href="ch04s02.html" title="4.2.&nbsp;Relationship of the subsystems">Section&nbsp;4.2, &#8220;Relationship of the subsystems&#8221;</a>.)
</p><p>
Write deprecation statements like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
     * @deprecated by <i class="replaceable"><tt>your name</tt></i> in <i class="replaceable"><tt>the upcoming release</tt></i>. Use {@link <i class="replaceable"><tt>whatever</tt></i>}
     *             <i class="replaceable"><tt>a complete explanation on what to do instead</tt></i>
</pre><p>
</p><p>

Rationale:
This is part of the "Do Simple Things"-development approach that we
use in ArgoUML.
ArgoUML is a big project with lots of legacy code that we do not know
exactly how it works.
Deprecation shows the intent between decision to remove a method and
the point where it is actually removed 
and this without breaking anything of the old code.
There are also modules or plug ins that we might know nothing about that
could be loaded by some user to run within ArgoUML to add functionality.
It is for the modules and plug ins that we always save 
deprecated methods to the next stable release.
It makes it possible for the module developers to do work during the 
unstable releases and release at the same time as ArgoUML releases its
stable release.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't use deprecated methods or classes.
</p><p>
Rationale:
Deprecation is an indication that a class is to be removed.
We always want to build ArgoUML in a way that allows for future updates
of everything.
Using things that are on the way out already when doing the implementation
is for this reason not allowed.
</p><p>
Rationale 2:
If you feel like you really want to use a method that is deprecated instead
of the replacement you should first convince the person responsible
for doing the deprecation that he has made a mistake and upgrade ArgoUML
to a version of that library without that method or class deprecated.
If it is within ArgoUML discuss it with the person who actually did 
the deprecation or in the development team.
</p><p>
Comment:
There is an ongoing work (probably perpetually) to change
the calls to deprecated methods and classes that
has been deprecated after used in ArgoUML.
This is a normal part of improving ArgoUML.
If this work is too slow it makes it impossible to upgrade to new
versions of different sub-tools. 
This problem is seen by "the person responsible for sourcing of the sub-tool"
when actually trying to upgrade the sub-tool.
(See <a href="ch11s08.html" title="11.8.&nbsp;How to relate issues to problems in subproducts">Section&nbsp;11.8, &#8220;How to relate issues to problems in subproducts&#8221;</a>.)
</p></li><li><p>
Don't use very long package and class names.
</p><p>
To make the code readable,
keep class names shorter than 25 chars, and
have at most four levels of packages.
</p><p>
Historically in the ArgoUML design,
a deep package structure has been used.
There are several places in the code where the package structure is
mimicking the UML hierarchy of objects resulting in impossibly long
package names like
<tt class="classname">org.argouml.model.uml.behavioralelements.collaborations.<i class="replaceable"><tt>class name</tt></i></tt>, and
<tt class="classname">org.argouml.uml.ui.behavior.common_behavior.<i class="replaceable"><tt>class name</tt></i></tt>.
</p><p>
While establishing the subsystems we use a two-level approach much
like the rest of the Java world.
For the subsystem API we always use:
<tt class="classname">org.argouml.<i class="replaceable"><tt>subsystem package name</tt></i></tt>
i.e. the classes are in the subsystem's directory and all subsystems have
package names that is a single level below <tt class="classname">org.argouml</tt>.
If a subsystem is really complex or will be complex
w.r.t. the amount of classes (meaning more than 50 files with classes),
we create new packages with internal classes on a single level below
the subsystem package.
</p><p>
This is the plan for the subsystems and new classes.
Don't move old classes just yet!
That would create more confusion that it would help.

For everything else follow
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html" target="_top">

Some of these rules are marked with a comment that they are 
checked by a Checkstyle.
Checkstyle is a tool available with the ArgoUML development environment
preconfigured for these rules.
The current configuration can be found in
<tt class="filename">argouml/tools/checkstyle/checkstyle_argouml.xml</tt>.
</p><p>
To run Checkstyle run the command
<span><b class="command">build checkstyle</b></span> from the
<tt class="filename">argouml/src_new</tt>
directory.
This requires you to have checked out the directories
<tt class="filename">argouml/tools</tt>,
<tt class="filename">argouml/tests</tt>, and
<tt class="filename">argouml/src_new</tt>.
</p><p>
The last couple of Checkstyle result are also available in 
the Xenofarm result.
</p><p>
Checkstyle will also check some of the rules from the
Sun Code Conventions that are not stated here.
Furthermore Checkstyle nags about when the order of modifiers does
not conform to the suggestions in the
Java Language Specification, Section 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3.
