The manual test cases are here to help us test ArgoUML in order to 
cover things that are not testable with the JUnit test cases.
Since it is a little bit more cumbersome to run them, 
a tester must 
read the test cases, 
understand what he is supposed to do,
do it, and
document the result,
we try to go as far as possible with the JUnit test cases
and have as few manual test cases as possible.
I.e. If one of these tests can be converted into a JUnit test case
we shall try to do so because it can save us a lot of time.
On the other hand, 
there are several things that cannot possibly be tested with JUnit tests,
so there probably are a lot of Manual Test Cases to be written.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1923"></a>2.6.1.&nbsp;Running the manual tests</h3></div></div></div><p>
Anyone can run the manual tests on any version of ArgoUML.
If it doesn't work, i.e. the expected result is not seen,
then this is a defect in that version of ArgoUML and should
be reported using Issuezilla.
</p><p>
At every release, 
the ambition is to run through all manual tests.
Initially, when the amount of manual tests is small, 
this is done by the release responsible while testing the newly compiled
release.
Later on,
when the amount of manual tests makes it unpractical
to this during the release work,
the work can be done by anyone,
or any group of people within the project,
after a development release is made and before a stable release is made.
A signed statement with list of run tests including version number,
a list (hopefully empty) of failed tests 
together with their Issuezilla DEFECT number,
the host type, OS, JDK version, ArgoUML version, ...
shall be mailed to the dev list when these tests are completed.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1930"></a>2.6.2.&nbsp;Writing the manual tests</h3></div></div></div><p>
Adding a new manual test to the group of already existing manual tests
or improving one of the existing tests helps the project forward.
Remember that the first priority is to test things with the JUnit
tests because they can be, to some extent, run automatically and
have their result reported automatically but then manual tests
are the next big improvement.
</p><p>
Every test has several attributes to make sure that we can identify
the test and help the developers and testers.
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A name</p><p>
This name is the title of the subsection where the test is described.
</p></li><li><p>A number</p><p>
These start with TEST1 and are allocated in sequence
and maintained manually in this document
(TEST2, TEST3, TEST4, ...).
They are never reused when made available by removing
a test case.
</p></li><li><p>A revision</p><p>
Every test case has a revision.
These start with REVa and are increased with one every time
the test case is changed.
</p></li><li><p>A list of requirements tested</p><p>
This list is references to the requirements as stated in
<a href="ch03.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;ArgoUML requirements">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>ArgoUML requirements</i></a>.
</p></li><li><p>Preparations i.e. what to do before the test</p><p>
This is Optional. The default is that you have just started ArgoUML.
</p></li><li><p>A description on what to do an what to expect</p><p>
This is a description in plain English telling the tester
exactly what to do and what to expect.
If this description doesn't work or is ambiguous in any way the tester
should consider the test to be DEFECT and report it in Issuezilla.

TEST2 REVa
(Requirements tested: 
<a href="ch03s02.html#REQ5" title="3.2.1.&nbsp;&#xA;ArgoUML shall be a correct implementation of the UML 1.4 model.&#xA;">Section&nbsp;3.2.1, &#8220;

<span class="emphasis"><em>Do:</em></span>
Select the Class Diagram.
Click the Package symbol on the Edit pane tool-bar.
Click on the diagram.
Click the Class symbol on the Edit pane tool-bar.
Click on the diagram.
Click the Interface symbol on the Edit pane tool-bar.
Click on the diagram.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Expected output:</em></span>
The Class diagram and the explorer now contains
one package,
one class, and
one interface.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Do:</em></span>
Select the class.
Drag from the four quick-buttons located along the sides of the class
and release somewhere on the diagram.
Click on the fifth quick-button (bottom-left of the class).
Select the interface.
Drag from the quick-button located along the bottom of the interface symbol
and release somewhere on the diagram.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Expected output:</em></span>
When releases on the diagram a new class is created 
both on the diagram, where released
and in the explorer.
The type of the association corresponds with the quick-button type.
The association created when clicking the fifth quick-button goes back
to the class itself.
