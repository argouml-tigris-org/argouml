Using Use Cases in ArgoUML</h2></div></div><p>ArgoUML allows you to draw use case diagrams. When you create a new
      project it has a use case diagram created by default, named <tt>use
      case diagram 1</tt>. Select this by button&nbsp;1 click on the diagram
      name in the navigation pane (the upper left quadrant of the user
      screen).</p><p>New use case diagrams can be created as needed through
      <tt>Create Diagram</tt> on the main menu bar. They are edited
      in the editing pane (the upper right quadrant of the user screen).</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2851"></a>3.4.1. Actors</h3></div></div><p>To add an actor to the diagram use button&nbsp;1 click on the actor
        icon on the editing pane toolbar
        (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/icons/actor.gif" align="center"></span>) and then button&nbsp;1 click
        at the location where you wish to place it. The actor can be moved
        subsequently by button&nbsp;1 motion (i.e button&nbsp;1 down over the actor to
        select it, move to the new position and button&nbsp;1 release to drop the
        actor in place.</p><p>Multiple actors can be added in one go, by using button&nbsp;1 double
        click on the actor icon. Each subsequent button&nbsp;1 click will drop an
        actor on the diagram. button&nbsp;1 on the select icon
        (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/icons/select.gif" align="center"></span>) to stop adding

        actor (if not already selected) on the editing pane using button&nbsp;1
        click. Then click on the <tt>Properties</tt> tab in the
        details pane. The name is entered in the name field, and will appear on
        the screen.</p><p>As a shortcut, double button&nbsp;1 click on the name of the actor in
        the editing pane (or just typing on the keyboard when an actor is
        selected) will allow the name to be edited directly. This is a
        convenient way to enter a name for a new actor.</p><p>Having created the actor, you will see it appear in the navigation
        pane (the upper left quadrant of the user screen). This shows all the
        artifacts created within the UML design. A drop down at the top of the
        navigation pane controls the ordering of artifacts in the navigation
        pane. The most useful are the <tt>Package-centric</tt>
        (default) and <tt>Diagram-centric</tt>. The latter shows

        can segment the line by holding down button&nbsp;1 down on the line and
        moving before releasing. A vertex will be added to the line, which you
        can move by button&nbsp;1 motion. A vertex can be removed by picking it up
        and sliding to one end of the line.</p><p>Multiple associations can be added in one go, by using button&nbsp;1
        double click on the association icon. Each subsequent button&nbsp;1

        associations.</p><p>It is also possible to add associations using small
        &#8220;handles&#8221; that appear to the left and right of a use case
        or actor when it is selected and the mouse is over it. Dragging the
        handle from a use case to an actor will create an association to that
        actor (and similarly by dragging a handle from an actor to a use
        case).</p><p>Dragging a handle from a use case into empty space will create a
        new actor to go on the other end. Similarly dragging a handle from an
        actor into empty space will create a new use case.</p><p>It is possible to give an association a name, describing the
        relationship of the actor to the use case, although this is not usually
        necessary. This is done through the property tab of the
        association. Such a name appears alongside the association near its

        such as use cases, to indicate that they belong to a certain
        category. Such labels are shown in guillemots

        if the actor is complex to refer to a separate document that holds
        information about the actor.</p><p>The documentation tab of use cases should record the location of

        place it behind everything else. However there is no way to change its
        fill color from the default white. You may therefore prefer to draw
        the boundary box as four lines. This is the method used for the
