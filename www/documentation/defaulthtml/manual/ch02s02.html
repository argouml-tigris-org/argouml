      since the 1960's, and as a design concept since 1972. However it was in
      the 1980's that it started to develop as a credible alternative to a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>functional approach</em></span> in analysis and design. We can
      identify a number of drivers.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The emergence of mainstream OO programming languages like
        SmallTalk and particularly C++. C++ was a pragmatic OO language derived
        from C, widely used because of its association with
        Unix.</p></li><li><p>The development of powerful workstations, and with them
        the emergence into the mainstream of windowing operating user
        environments. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) have an inherent object
        structure.</p></li><li><p>A number of very public major project failures,
        suggesting that current approaches were not
        satisfactory.</p></li></ol></div><p>A number of researchers proposed OOA&amp;D processes, and with them
      notations. Those that achieved some success include Coad-Yourdon, Booch,
      Rumbaugh OMT, OOSE/Jacobson, Shlaer-Mellor, ROOM (for real-time design)
      and the hybrid Jackson Structured Development.</p><p>During the early 1990's it became clear that these approaches had
      many good ideas, often very similar. A major stumbling block was the
      diversity of notation, meaning engineers tended to be familiar with one
      OOA&amp;D methodology, rather than the approach in general.</p><p>UML was conceived as a common notation, that would be in the
      interests of all involved. The original standard was driven by Rational
      Software (<a href="http://www.rational.com" target="_top">www.rational.com</a>,
      in which three of the key researchers in the field (Booch, Jacobson and
      Rumbaugh were involved). They produced documents describing v0.9 and
      v0.91 during 1996. The effort was taken industry wide through the
      Object Management Group (OMG), already well known for the CORBA
      standard. A first proposal, 1.0 was published in early 1997, with an
      improved version 1.1 approved that autumn.</p><p>ArgoUML is based on UML v1.3, which was adopted by OMG in November
      1999. UML v1.4 has recently been approved (2001). A major revision, UML
      v2.0 is planned to be completed in 2002.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;UML Based OOA&amp;D&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;2.3.&nbsp;UML Based Processes for OOA&amp;D</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
