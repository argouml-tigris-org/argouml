<title>Argo/UML UML Specification Incompatibility list</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Known Incompatibilities</h1>
<p>Here is a list of features which are not implemented yet and can be seen as a violation of the UML specification (1.3):
</p>
<h2>Class Diagram</h2>
<ul>
<li>Association classes are missing. Though ArgoUML can read association classes from XMI files, it cannot display them correctly. That is due to a flaw in GEF, which needs a major rework.
<li>Parameterized clases are missing
<li>Packages can have stereotypes, but they are not displayed
<li>Notes to <i>any</i> model element not implemented
</ul>
<h2>Object Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>implemented as Deploymentdiagram
<li>Attributes cannot have attribute values
</ul>
<h2>Activity Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swimlanes missing
</ul>
