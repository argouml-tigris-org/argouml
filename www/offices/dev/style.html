				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Each file starts with some header info: file, classes in this file,
				original author's email address, and version control info. <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I am using the import ...*; command to keep the code short. I perfer
				to let name conflicts arrise so that I can catch them, rather than always use explicit package.class names and
				end up with code that cannot be changed to the package-name-only style. (Note: This means that if you make a zip
				file for use in your CLASSPATH, you must use a version of the zip tool that includes directory entries.) <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">All instance variables are protected and their names begin with an underscore.
				If the variable should be accessible then add public or protected accessor methods with the same name as the variable
				without the underscore with &quot;get&quot; or &quot;set&quot; prepended. For example: _lineWidth, setLineWidth(),
				and getLineWidth(). <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">In general, write short code. If a method will fit comfortably on one
				line, then put it on one line. <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Use javadoc for each class, instance variable, and method. In general
				do not put comments in the body of a method. If you are doing something complex enough to need a comment, consider
				breaking it out into its own commented method. <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Indicate places of future modifications with &quot;// Needs-More-Work:
				reason&quot; <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Name all classes with an initial uppercase letter, and all variables
				and methods with a lowercase one. I use the allTogetherWithCaps naming style. Name static variables with an underscore
				and an inital capital letter, e.g., _PossibleLanguages. Name constants with all upper case and underscores, e.g.,
				GRIP_MARGIN. <BR>
				<BR>
				</FONT>
				<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">To emphasize clusters of classes I am using what I call the binomial
				naming style (I am sure others have thought of this also): The root class of the cluster has a short name (e.g.,
				Layer), other members of the cluster use that name as a prefix (e.g., LayerGrid). This makes many of the class
				name longer than they might be normally (e.g., Grid would be shorter). But this provides a lot of context without
				having to look at a class inheritance diagram. It is also very nice when you have to look at an alphabetical list
				of classes. I try to name class clusters so that they are not lexigraphically close others (e.g., the Net cluster
				used to be named Model, but that lexigraphically overlapped the Mode cluster). <BR>
