<h1>ArgoUML Release Plan</h1>

Even numbers are for stable versions. 
The preceeding odd second number is the corresponding not so stable version.
Example: 0.14 is a stable versions of 0.13.*.
0.14.1 is a stable bug fix release of 0.14.
0.even are on the main branch (or extremely close to it).
The main branch is always working towards the future.
<p>

Releases will only be made when there are no failing tests.
The purpose of this is to avoid any confusing discussion about
what tests were failing or are supposed to be failing and replace it
with the clear facts, if a test was 
"included in a release"/"tagged with the release tag",
that test succeeded for that release.
