<H2>ArgoUML JobJar</H2>

<H3>Take on a Task</H3>

A lot of work has gone into developing ArgoUML, but much more still
remains to be done.
<P>

Here is a list of pending tasks that you might be interested in
doing. Each of these tasks would be a personally satisfying
contribution toward making the ArgoUML vision a reality.
Please join the
<A HREF="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">developers mailing list (dev)</A> 
to discuss tasks that you are interested in.

<H3>Special Note to Students</H3>

Each task could be made into an undergraduate term project or part of
a masters degree project. 
Working on a free, open source software project such as ArgoUML can
make your school project much more impressive, satisfying, and clarify
potential benefits.

Why start with nothing if you could build on the work of over a dozen
other students?  

Why end your term project with just a grade when you could make a
visible difference?  

The point of a term project is to get experience working on a
&quot;real&quot; project. Using ArgoUML will give you experience with
over 60,000 lines of Java code that implements a very real
application.
<P>

<H3>Tasks</H3>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Use ArgoUML</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Try out ArgoUML and make issues of things that are buggy or awkward.
		<LI>Try to use it for a small design project. What is useful about
		the tool? What is needed?
		<LI>Watch others use ArgoUML and report on how they use it.
	</UL>
	<LI><B>UML Diagram</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Implement a graph layout algorithm that takes into account the
		conventions of UML diagrams.
		<LI>Implement arc routing that users find flexible and convient.
		
		<LI>Implement the UML artifacts that ArgoUML still does not support, see 
        <A HREF="documentation/umlsupport">UMLsupport</A>. 
		<LI>Implement diagram types that are part of UML but not supported
		by ArgoUML yet, see 
        <A HREF="documentation/umlsupport">UMLsupport</A>.
		<LI>Enable connection to class names to object names.<!-- Huh? -->
		Use case: When the user clicks on the
		properties pane for an object, the user has the option
		of choosing from a list of UML artifacts: classes,
		actors, etc.
		<LI>Include edit commands under right click ...
		
		<LI>Swim lanes for statechart and activity diagrams. 
		<LI>Implement printing of wall-sized diagram posters or design booklets.
		<LI>For more ideas on diagram editing enhacements, see the
		<A HREF="http://gef.tigris.org/">GEF Web Site</A>.
	</UL>
	<LI><B>UML Meta-Model</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Add an JDBC interface to the UML meta-model so that models can
		be stored in databases. (Work has already started on this.)
		<LI>Add the ability to save the UML meta-model to a file using Java's
		ObjectSerialization library.
		
		<LI>Add an external file format for compatability with other tools, to enhance 
        ArgoUML's XMI support. 
		<LI>Generate an HTML reference web site for a UML model, much like
		JavaDoc does for Java code.
		<LI>Recode parts of the meta-model to remove some current simplifying
		assumptions.
		<LI>Enable data base modelling.
		<LI>Enable import interface for XML documents.
	</UL>
	<LI><B>Code Generation and Reverse Engineering</B>
	<UL>
      <LI>Implement code generation for an additional programming language. 
      <LI>Implement support for generating Java code that follows JavaBeans
		conventions.
		<LI>Implement an extensible and customizable library for code generation
		in many languages.
		<LI>Implement code generation for UML state machine models.
		<LI>Generate assert() statements to check OCL constraints on a UML
		model at run-time.
		<LI>Integrate a <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/suntest">Java parser</A> into ArgoUML to accept
		fragments of code entered in diagrams.
		<LI>Use a Java parser to read code from files and construct a model.
		<LI>Enable .jar reverse engineering. 
		Perhaps using the parser that is available in the JDK
		distribution for generating javadocs from a jar?

		<LI>Java RE to read package.html files in the source tree and
		add the information to MPackages.
		Java gereration to create a new package.html.

	</UL>
	<LI><B>User Interface</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Implement more table views of UML packages, classes, state machines,
		etc. <!-- table views?-->
		<LI>Improve any aspect of Argo's user interface and show that it is
		better.
		<LI>Implement Undo.
		<LI>Make ArgoUML work within Netbeans and Eclipse.
		<LI>Add pop-up menus to several parts of Argo's interface.
		<LI>Implement a vertically split explorer: lower half to show
		details of the upper selection.
		<LI>Set the save as field when user selects File &gt;
		"save graphics" the "file name" of the project" file
		of type" automatically i.e. "myproject.svg" for
		example.
	</UL>
	<LI><B>Publishing the result</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Implement a function to publish a complete view of the project
		in a set of graphically enhanced HTML file. 
		This should include a choice of graphical output i.e. SVG, PNG, etc.
	</UL>
	<LI><B>User Documentation</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Write additions to the User's manual for ArgoUML, 
		focus on a specific task or audience.
