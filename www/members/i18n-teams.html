<h2>Internationalization teams</h2>

<P>
The following people are committed to do the internationalization 
and localization work in the ArgoUML project.
<P>
Each group is responsible for all issues regarding a certain 
language/region/country.

<UL>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(default) English (American English)</STRONG>
    <br>
    All developers maintain this while working with the code.
    <br>
    For ArgoUML the default language is American English (en_US).
    This is to be used in all non-localized texts.
    <br>
    Notice that javadoc comments and variable names,
    log messages (through log4j and System.out),
    and
    design documentation (cookbook and web site),
    are not localized but always written in American English 
    (en_US).
    This means that all developers of ArgoUML must know English.
    <br>
    Notice also that there is no (en) files.
    They are not needed since it is the default.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(fr) French - Francais</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Jean-Hugues de Raigniac
      <LI>Luc Maisonobe
    </UL>
    fr defaults in ArgoUML to the French spoken in France (fr_FR).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(ru) Russian</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Alexey Aphanasyev
    </UL>
    ru defaults in ArgoUML to the Russian spoken in Russia (ru_RU).
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(de) German - Deutch</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Harald Braun
      <LI>Achim Spangler
    </UL>
    de defaults in ArgoUML to the German spoken in Berlin (?) (de_??).
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(es) Spanish</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Ricardo Varela
      <LI>Cecilia Alvarez
    </UL>
    es defaults in ArgoUML to the Spanish spoken in Spain (es_ES).
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <STRONG>(ca) Catalan</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Marc Valerio i Brau
    </UL>
    ca defaults in ArgoUML to the Catalan spoken in Spain (ca_ES).
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <STRONG>(en_GB) English as spoken in Great Britain</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Alex Bagehot
    </UL>
  </LI>

</UL>
For each language there is always a default region/country that is listed
here.
Secondary regions/countries (as en_GB) can be started but must
be for a different region than the default one.
