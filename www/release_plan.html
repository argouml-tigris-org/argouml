<h1>ArgoUML Release Plan</h1>

<p>Even numbers are for stable versions. 
The preceding odd second number is the corresponding not so stable version.
Example: 0.24 is a stable versions of 0.23.*. <br>
0.24.1 is a stable bug fix release of 0.24.0. <br>
Even releases are on the main branch (or extremely close to it).
The main branch is always working towards the future.</p>

<p>
Releases will only be made when there are no failing tests.
The purpose of this is to avoid any confusing discussion about
what tests were failing or are supposed to be failing and replace it
with the clear facts, if a test was 
"included in a release"/"tagged with the release tag",
that test succeeded for that release.

<p>
Planned date: 2006-09-09
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First step towards a split-model repository
      (<a href="/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3497">issue 3497</a>).

<h3>Conversion of the ArgoUML projects to Subversion</h3>
<p>
Originally Planned date: 2006-09-10 (immediately after 0.23.1)<br>
Planned date set by the staff that is actually going to do it:
2006-09-17 through 2006-09-28 depending on the project.
For details see
<a href="http://www.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=195">issue 195</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is a big risk that any uncommitted work will be lost or hard
to recover after this process so all developers shall make sure everything is
committed (at least in a working branch).
After the conversion, any checked out CVS copy is useless and should be removed
and a new check out using Subversion (SVN) is required.
